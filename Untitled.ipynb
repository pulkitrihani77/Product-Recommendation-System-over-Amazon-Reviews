refrence speaker dedicated home theater room i eventually replace klipsch ceiling in ceiling speaker tricky set get right sound if music disappoint surround ambience best painted black take fabric behind grill looks great sound great as advertised easy install sound really good i neither audiophile skilled craftsman appreciate elegant home theater set like thing these speaker fit bill count i

rock solid stable stand work well enough way corner location they take light bump hold small child grabbing hold yanking overly excited labrador with older carpet padding stand sit spike quite bit even lowest setting they however adjustable anyone complaint overall height carpet please try adjusting spike replacing carpet in case anyone still wondering two stand package i received part listed instruction though blister pack contained opened resealed tape most likely early quality control issue part left corrected factory shipped distributor the instruction useless consists illustration written instruction rocket science the screw fit without splitting excessive effort might another factory correction i heard complain splitting smaller hole as others stated difficult part installing wire channel the illustration indicate bending film channel inserting side slit back stand this impossible obvious way need done simply leave top unattached slide bottom edge film channel top move slowly i took time bent film approximate shape slid i used one palm keep pressure already inserted part keep track using hand squeeze slide rest film movement i issue using technique highly recommend using pressure already inserted piece finish back could damaged film slip the piece film get hard install end i used flat piece wood push rest way note two piece size film need use one size per stand total install time stand minute the neoprene piece small really little thicker allow speaker sit little use thicker speaker wire major concern i oily palm i noticed finish stand show oil however furniture polish help give stand little luster reduce effect given option stand i say excellent value well worth extra time installation however local ups people le delicate stuff beware packaging assembly quick easy problem tried sliding back panel used hide speaker wire chipped wood various area also ensure speaker secure use two sided tape based overall love look good pretty decent cost this

factory speaker expect fact paper i wanted newer one last worked great mazda front back didn manipulate product make fit had drill hole fit speaker course besides nothing else requires i strongly recommend using bootmat baffle offset space speaker adapter also improve speaker sound quality i purchased pyle s speakers because i don t have money for high end stuff i still have a pair of bose bookcase speakers watt eic rated ea and a set of polk in ceiling speakers cost but i studied pyle s products and liked their prices and choices i ve been pleasantly surprised with results i spent hours building cabinets wall cavities playing with baffles configuring speaker placements and impedances etc and while the speakers sound fine just mounted in the ceiling or wall you can achieve unbelievable quality sound by finding the best placement for each room and matching or more sets of speakers it takes some time but when you move the speakers around and position them you ll eventually find a resonance sound that will blow you away i could go on but will just say that so far i have purchased sets of speakers pair pair total the pdic s were the rest were per pair hope this helps other budget stretchers like me snapped snug didn need drilling i consider audiophile i huge system i built year big power hungry practical current situation i purchased ifi system play music

like type sound signature i call crisp distinct yet warm smooth side okay like here design problem real serious easily fixed i write polk day design problem after i day enjoying sound lot i occasionally noticed sort little fizzt fuzz sound whiz especially particular register higher end i thought left speaker tweeter problem i listened various thing trying pick wrong then i tried tightening connection realized one might little loose the problem seemed go away i happy then came back day importantly i truly think many people would hear little bit problem intermittent really bugging i trying figure would happening finally i decided something wrong left speaker i going take back maybe set i already spent hour trying figure frustrated as i disconnecting left speaker i noticed something metal strip connects post bi amping feature it loose even though wire nut tightened way what bi amping a speaker bi amping allows run separate amplifier high end speaker low end give two set post connect wire one high one low now honestly polk would build function speaker price point mystifies only really hard core audiophiles going interested buying polk speaker price range trust here matter get pair you likely interested bi amping here metal strip lose mine come the metal strip connects two negative post together two positive post together connect speaker wire one set post others connected get high low end the problem design once speaker wire hole nut post tightened wire tight least i could make little metal strip still locked place i could speaker tighten nut far enough actually solidly clamp little strip place they slightly loose connecting speaker wire mean connection one set post solid hence hour fiddling around i realized i disconnecting speaker return high end one side sometimes little tiny bit fritzy if get want problem solve one several way after connect speaker wire try wiggling little brass colored metal strip see obvious i mean see see two picture i posted if wiggle need solve problem the way i solved cut four short wire connect set plus minus post red black speaker along course reconnecting wire amplifier one set post speaker essentially i created better connection high low end speaker polk supplied given bi amping design another solution would connect speaker using banana plug this would solve problem tighten nut connection post way without speaker wire needing go post metal strip held solidly make good contact again cannot picture trust obvious speaker i highly recommend speaker just check carefully metal strip looseness connect amplifier solve problem exists looking buy bos surround system price high found polk audio system unbelievable amazing sound clear high frequency sound crystal clear even heard

trebele right speaker i doubt desktop speaker available price point sound better i purchased i le expensive altec lansing vs set another desktop happy listed cnet best pc speaker list behind audioengine model start around the sound quality fantastic i docking single star annoyingly short cable difficult impossible extend the cnet review refers cable proprietary technically true the cable mini din mdin extended somewhat readily available extension cable monoprice vendor the speaker cable mdin pin otherwise known s video people probably remember high end vcrs the volume controller mdin pin used apple laser printer long ago i able get feel like waiting extender cable mdin cable male female end opted standard s video cable male end paired gender changer since stock unfortunately gender changer stay firmly connected i ended aborting attempt putting subwoofer desk stock cable would reach enough cable the main reason i bought sound quality i disappointed the high extremely clear detailed the tweeter could described bright normally i think brightness negative attribute i find bright speaker fatiguing listen extended period i find i tiring listening hour time i think high accurate overall response flat because satellite way subwoofer go hz entire spectrum well covered the subwoofer plenty powerful enough shake floor moderate volume stereo imaging good presenting wide soundstage appears extend center monitor past edge desk lastly aesthetic nice exactly i looking the computer desk i tinted glass top exactly match smoked plexiglas satellite almost appear extension desk surface the volume knob amber leds give sort retro look volume tone indicator bar rotates series animation idle the animation serve useful purpose i think add retro feel i know going i like in summary interested good sound reasonable price like look probably everyone place subwoofer close proximity satellite i highly recommend as reviewer claimed bit muddled i suspect due downfiring midrange left right speaker subwoofer kick though overall i happy maybe adding flared underside midrange would help muddy sound first i would like share gratitude amazon com export dept done shipping within appropriate fastest delivery lower shipping cost relatively i parcel sent item national pos malaysia received good packaging thanks amazon com great service helpful effective solution customer service worker earth i guess back item i received item yet observing detail performance but tested briefly using pc winamp player awesome sound compared enzatech tough high quality built casing rich bass treble output much eq setup acquire great output the preset eq inside already increase richness k k freq band naturally crispy sound db eq you believe small twin speaker could perform loudness like the sound scrambled even though max volume set it firmly grab table rubber padded bottom good tilting angle made transmits excellent crispy sound closely the on off switch located behind cylinder may bit uneasy grab need twist knob overall small altech lancing done greatly updated oct i found illustrated item page bit different i got may nd version i got black stand volume knob speaker cover the one advertisment look elegant mine anyway i enjoyed great sound rather little appearance change i purchased speaker three year ago i really like sturdiness sound they perfect small large room loud clear the subwoofer fire downward floor delivers great tight bass sitting two satellite table work area take much space i would like wire connecting two little longer designed desk table sit nicely rear the sound quality comparable expensive speaker loud enough music game video instrument ect whatever want use i use music laptop deliver quite nicely i paid almost double going three year ago still quite satisfied sitting subwoofer floor satellite table control volume power power supplied included ac adapter on tiled carpeted floor bass tight strong loud without boomy satellite deliver sharp detail i would recommend for computer speaker pretty good sub another story cant expect amazing explosion sound movie however buck pretty good nice step super basic stuff homework computer wear headphone every time audio tech x esh speaker survive well thing i would change wheel thing switch left side turn i wish blue button looking thing button show i really enjoyed cyber acoustics speaker system first the main problem i speaker top heavy easy knock the left speaker finally became problematic loud erratic static setting it may fault since i frequently inadvertently knocked speaker dusting moving thing around desk however fragile speaker would much stable larger base the static last straw i putting system turning even blue light control pad switch position pc either sleeping hibernating the system would emit low humming sound blue light would blink the reason i chose system control pod i really loved convenience control pod system periodically turn switch set made worry could short system wiring i audiophile i think sound quality system good i liked system well working i even briefly considered replacing model trying construct new base speaker however i saw logitech z system also control pod much better balanced speaker i decided purchase system instead i differentiate sound either system the cyber acoustics control pod bass control logitech volume control i prefer logitech system strictly compact nicely weighted speaker pros very easy setup use trebles clear bass deep sound par expensive z i hooked wife pc now i building another htpc i decided give eagle try happier couch potato like really like wireless remote control lotr fanatic know loud movie get i needed quick way turn volume quickly boost treble bass quieter part movie cons user manual typo the rca audio cable coming satellite short i mean come arm longer okay annoying deal breaker since picked pair rca audio cable le local radio shack store the thing reason speaker would turn on volume turned i later found actually resets digital eq whenever power turned off what argggg annoying deal breaker since i left on time biggie conclusion if looking spend around set name brand speaker one probably job fine saving money amazon free shipping make complete steal mine arrived day shipping charge just wow arion legacy studio quality speakers inch subwoofer inch tweeter trapezoid wooden cabinets ac powered w rms ar purchased time death initially speaker go bad tweeter going early buying replaced arion that good early i would expect good service though later developed interference light buzzing sound customer service arion swap due year later give advice thing check per suggestion i getting interference wifi router i recently moved bit close i swapped speaker left right reversed input cable maintain proper stereo fine that arion although odd would pick shielding would nice necessarily pc speaker now i horribly loud buzzing seems transformer inside failing i find part

subwoofer these great sounding stereo speaker range sound beat system anywhere short i heard my logitech z beat far still kicking year i might add right i rather pay every often pay big buck i also split time headphone logi g speaker required full time presumably preserve would i recommend if want great sounding speaker want count year come if want excellent sound budget spend buy something proven ok risk sure obviously i feel way since i nd set due price drop i cost higher if go badly i sure update adding picture transformer i believe killed current set posterity i picked blue i trying

truth advertising law i heard appreciative result i could certainly hear sound projecting forward side le convincing i certainly hear sound coming behind speaker situated front tv like claim rather using forward firing driver logitech speaker acoustically engineered forward backward firing driver so sound projected reflected evenly wider range space result your whole room becomes sweet spot filled clear rich music even behind speaker quote amazon product page the speaker do fill room sound that claim seems bit stretched the speaker loud decent certainly substitute real sound system they

speaker i sure i fully trust one holding one amp electronics rock bit i fully comfortable thing might come bit loose serious tune the bad the plastic trim piece cover mounting bracket wall thin shiny plastic seems held place good intention cost star the instruction call drilling screw side speaker pedestal grab better i known buying i probably would passed overall i pleased i would give star actual option i picked pair bic america dv si bic america dv si bookshelf speakers pair black also star review looking great sounding speaker came without ability mount wall pound heavy use existing wall mount so i research ended choosing everything else here four thing sold it could hold pound mean holding pound issue even vibration i read review i saw hold pound review stated would fail speaker problem this already star review saying worked flawlessly how could i refute after reading product bad review one really stood this grab speaker bottom instead needing drill speaker thus relying speaker support weight i speaker expert everything else seemed fail quite often held onto back speaker i got really concerned because speaker box vibrates wall mount i think replace entire speaker these looked pretty amazing i really liked clean look appealed there one thing made hesitate price you find thing hold heavy speaker half price end i wanted purchase something i knew would work i decided go setup real easy took half hour put speaker i would faster i almost turn contortionist get one speaker furniture located so clean shot wall able throw twenty twenty five minute and look great every tuesday night i host movie night neighbor none visited without commenting look i upload picture i two week subjected speaker much punishment possible worked flawlessly i could happier turned i decided probably best idea use phone play music i kayaking i also old ipod sitting around house collecting dust so phone stay key id locked watertight case clipped inside front storage box kayak the iluv clip right onto kayak loud enough definitely used volume level when listening max getting headache distortion sounds clear but max way loud especially two foot away for price steal yes i fully aware thing waterproof but i kayaking quiet lake getting soaked either i highly recommend one for cost worth these speaker awesome couple hour placing speaker setting everything i amazed sound quality yes better expensive speaker value quality get price cannot beat i purchased set second hand friend never got installed i hesitant first i looking basic real home theater system looked like pc speaker set enough power desk use anyway price good internet review good friend needed money closed deal the thing well packaged satellite speaker good weight wire included long enough smallish tv room i htpc connected tv via hdmi the tv digital coaxial audio logitech set one digital coaxial audio so make thing simple i connected cable i switching input speaker set whatever playing tv hear speaker and source hear and wow sound thing amazing clear clean with enough control adjust subwofer level surround speaker the subwofer powerful enough muddy give low frequency expected hear pc system the overall volume enough room maybe large room find bit lacking so i happy system i definitively recommend looking real entry level medium small room home theater system i purchased replace promedia ultra i say logitech done many thing nicely here list good bad pros satellites small enough fit monitor i center speaker directly underneath monitor fit nicely the klipsch center channel speaker bulky designed fit underneath lcds speaker cover make easy keep clean dust free i enjoy dusting klipsch satellite speaker cover control module come decoder dolby digital dts optical input i plan use mine anything analog connector need decoding i wish i could bought version without extra probably add product con subwoofer look cheap sticker stating carb compliant at least use real painted wood give weight i paid promedia back lasted year then i paid another get refurbished promedia ultra high defect original promedia the ultra lasted year eventually broke i think z provides excellent value i think anyone else make high end pc speaker really choice good clear powerful sound subwoofer heat bit cooling radiator designed unit if want keep subwoofer cool improvise like i i installed cheap cooling fan apparatus i able get away using m heavy duty mounting tape now heat reduced least idle music playback the fan hooked usb port power ok i using soundbar system wireless sub long time sound decent great i knew i needed upgrade i old logitech surround sound speakers computer still sound amazing year old so i decided get logitech living room now hooking super easy very happy system us regular speaker wire sound quality clear crisp placement key speaker once i wall mounted front left right speaker installed rear right left stand completely changed sound i know may sound like stupid thing say placement drastically changed sound room i extremely pleased quality like others said volume shake house lol even volume cranked still sound clear distorted now reason i say bang buck would hard pressed find complete system quality price sure speaker set good still need receiver speaker connect add another buck the sub woofer awesome anyone say otherwise probably like bass loud literally

cellphone tablet bluetooth device like logitech wireless speaker adapter amp the result outstanding using amp bluetooth audio receiver i brought great sound back room amp untethered device speaker of course going use logitech adapter lepai digital audio amplifier might i suggest purchasing set audio cable rather using y cable come device these item must buy anyone like music cost buying outweighs mediocre sound overpriced iproduct accessory especially since one sell anything compatible android user this adapter pair fine iphone droid ipad hp touchpad edit year later i also used galaxy nexus phone computer usb bluetooth adapter i connected sony strdh channel d av receiver energy take classic home theater speakers sound good some device sound better others fault product the range good keep mind range half determined device end bluetooth connection after pair device first time using button adapter need connect whichever device want play audio require go press button adapter least device you cannot play one device time make sure previous device disconnected try connect new one so example typical switch device routine i hit connect logitech adapter bluetooth setting android phone i play music phone if i want start playing another device instead i hit disconnect logitech adapter phone then i go connect logitech adapter touchpad start playing music the previous device auto disconnect go try connect new one simply connect but good part go press button adapter manually everything far connecting reconnecting done device overall great adapter especially price this speaker

typically issue radio reception with device antenna sufficient effective the reception noteworthy excellent volume i even put device past level i pleased fill relatively small bedroom i need much way volume i wanted something would lift sound beyond small speaker ipod this sony dock totally meet need remote control to honest i reviewed product amazon page deciding purchasing i care le remote control but i say i already used remote actually find convenient i physically near dock silly i realize truly bad feature it deal breaker surprisingly nice option sound quality when i first encountered bose dock came back device absolutely shocked ability convey full sonic experience i hunch one favorite mine quite time i think bose price absolutely unnecessary i chose sony i taken pace yet even level sound quite inviting i enjoying mega bass feature i think noticeable overcompensating antenna set up easy antenna made cheap cheap plastic i bit surprised cheap looked felt quality signal still excellent i live i pretend know device would grab signal remote location physical appearance feel it feel little plastic ky nearly everything world made plastic we get away stuff what would expect product made metal housing if dropped might delicate piece merchandise make wonder well would hold falling foot tall bedroom dresser accident occurred solve problem putting near middle

paying price i thought price would backed quality i trust sony product i needed something little louder alarm taking new overnight job week but i also wanted device would produce little volume room i able meet need sony device recommendation i would recommend prospective customer the pyle home prjle portable led projector many great feature quality first support p p video inputs allowing use bluray player dvd player pc even tablet using usb hdmi adaptor i love two hdmi input component video vga input i hooked projector bluray player photo i provided i played the seventh son day blind

overall i think projector great price range i delighted opportunity purchase item reduced price use evaluation exchange honest unbiased review pros nice bright picture lots essential feature control long lasting led lighting many choice connecting source portable sound good project backwards toward very easy set cons does come hdmi cable i bought replace bluetooth speaker i kitchen the main gripe i device fact i would pair device iphone ipad every time i wanted use i sure issue bluetooth speaker case three bluetooth device i home since i buying kitchen also important small footprint this speaker fit requirement better attractive speaker i could find also i like donut shaped look maybe i fond donut the second thing i wanted work battery when i people i like cleaner look without cable running outlet while critical issue something i wanted i tested long last running battery couple hour enough also grab donut base set anywhere when i want use garage sunroom always available the final feature important i airplay device house airport express denon receiver apple tvs i always liked fact airplay device available time this mean i pull open app iphone preference mog fom inside network i see airplay speaker i send stream wherever i network i run issue main network i also second network airport express rather troubleshooting issue i moved device second network worked much better this lead believe issue address assigns i lot device network i surprised there program download tell ip every device i need mess i still occasional dropout i initially start streaming speaker usually work pretty good my airplay device rarely ever dropout bit mystifying annoying often i live however i take star one cool aspect i leave iphone living room still adjust volume directly speaker kitchen therefore volume changed ios device speaker while bluetooth may work people airplay work better situation the downside bluetooth besides i mentioned range if i bedroom want send audio kitchen phone still charging bedroom done airplay with bluetooth would possible also airplay better sound quality bluetooth device technically bit perfect cd quality many bluetooth device use compression the upside bluetooth rely wifi take anywhere however feature irrelevant since i bought specifically home use i mention i rating based sound quality i find pretty good compared bluetooth speaker i believe main audio system unless really care stereo separation important aspect overall sound that said i expecting sound much worse based size i think far le tinny i expecting especially reading review i think sound pretty good lower mid volume for record i iphone s rd generation ipad work fine speaker also i post pic interested seeing different picture update i wanted mention i decided hook ipad usb keep together kitchen the upside i kitchen without iphone i choose play without tracking device airplay the great part i still use mog pandora etc play music speaker via usb the downside reason video apps like directv slingbox put audio via usb i researched issue i found solution with slingbox i send audio ipad speaker via airplay i usually unhook usb use ipad speaker i want watch tv i mainly listen music big deal when i using music i run clock app aquarium app look great kitchen counter i also happy i keep usb plugged time charging i choose send speaker audio via airplay iphone speaker automatically switch without need manual switching the appletv also added choice airplay speaker around house rather receiver plugged i start music apple tv send audio signal kitchen without missing beat my favorite choice still using remote app iphone since i send audio signal multiple device i play music home different system via airplay pretty cool working around house the philips fidelio

negative device certainly one remedied time philips don buy speaker iphone recent ipad there no lightning connector old wide pin plug if read amazon ad see misleading claim work newer apple product made last year in fine print logitech say need buy expensive adapter apple connect lightning device i imagine logitech chooses sell model obsolete connector i spent hour trying connect directly wifi network it easy see logitech say preferred method it work multiple attempt rather sending back immediately i ordered adapter update review arrives using connector apple i able get connected network couple try you find right logitech app app store one ue end sounds great ok i really hate admit i actually bought without hearing i looking smaller portable solution happened go bose web site saw i several bose product always happy so i decided order one i actually ordered bose i wanted leather cover best buy yet so i opened box plugged get battery wake paired iphone ipad that amazingly simple then best part i started play music i exactly i wanted now loud sounddock i also sound amazing now i read review people expect sound like home theater system if i love sounddock pretty big although portable i wanted something smaller sounddock pretty much stay room also i wanted something connects ipad bluetooth device this perfect solution now i know people say bose expensive ever deal support understand one reason cost they best support i rarely use also quality bose product always exceptional bose soundlink exception you regret purchase enjoy year come if look review might notice already tried lot portable speaker i must confess like bass i basshead must certain amount base make music sound appealing i hate shrill speaker sound like mobile phone cutoff every frequency hz so far best speaker nice sound size ratio bose sounddock portable still large heavy really carried around now bose announced soundlink mobile speaker week ago i became curious hear i went bose store next day final result get store one soundlink additional red cover the soundlink really impressed lot already i played first tune bose store i also able compare directly sounddock portable sound pretty similar the soundlink sound bit like slightly downsized version i would say sound downsized le overall body on soundlink bass reach low let say resonance frequency lower sounddock present upper bass frequency soundlink still speaker seem similar range regarding bass response really hear deep bass soundlink despite minuscule size on soundlink treble bit recessed frequency hump upper mid frequency sounddock overall sound still comparable notice listen side side due differently tuned bass soundlink might sound bit boomy little room outside sound rich full lot power unlike portable speaker scream around without base it make lot fun listening music soundlink it enough base make dance housekicks enough energy really felt unlike speaker hear plock plock i would even say older recording early mastered brutal bass amount like modern piece sound still surprisingly powerful soundlink i surprised good powerful quincy jones perfectly mastered the dude sounded soundlink also george benson breezin in flight sound spectacular soundlink on hand really bassy recording might somewhat top i tune set bass reducer eq iphone order make sound good compared popular jambox foxl bluetooth speaker i would say comparison both foxl jambox sound like toy compared soundlink the soundlink really compromise frequency music you hear feel bass mids smooth treble clear although would preferred slightly clearer especially listening soundlink axis treble becomes bit dull it sound best directly front you also turn pretty loud distort i often wanted crank jambox already started distort still much low taste the bose soundlink sound perfect level jambox even reach it even higher level start hearing slight compression peak music at highest level also bass level reduced soundlink still sound pretty audible music never fall apart i experience distortion yet tell truth prefer slightly compressed sound distorted one a better competitor soundlink would logitech s similar upcoming bluetooth boombox plugged logitech sound quite good bose still better defined lower reaching bass treble much harsher logitech if run battery logitech loses whole power start sounding shrill soundlink louder powerful bass department time i would even claim soundlink sound powerful harman kardon go play run battery also main critisim go play like speaker jbl hk sound worse battery it impress lot prof much know bose put speaker little company they claim produce full powerful sound none come even close soundlink the maximum volume certainly lower sounddock portable i would say sounddock able play double loud soundlink but highest volume sounddock already distorts considerably compress music much soundlink the soundlink still louder portable speaker size if still know virgin boomtube ex the soundlink similar high output much powerful bass when i showed new toy wife first asked crazy buy another speaker but meanwhile allow use claim of course soundlink cannot compete mini speaker like jambox much larger i think jamboxes would fit inside soundlink but even jamboxes sound convincing like single soundlink and might argue high price look price jambox tivoli pal price appear high anymore it also buck cheaper sounddock portable argument i test battery life yet bose claim hour normal level i sure would play even longer already bose claim regarding sounddock battery life conservative the soundlink battery wh replaceable although according bose still spare part i able take battery removing screw allen key came mounting alternative cover if really want perfect sounding portable speaker think bose give you cannot put trouser pocket still small enough find place bag backpack kudos bose giving u nice little gadget i sure wife lot fun the problem what shall jambox update now recent release big jambox i able listen side side i still think portable solution soundlink unbeaten it much better form factor big jambox around bigger overall volume the sound better refined soundlink while many tend think soundlink sound muffled boomy reality stronger bass order get lost played outside played inside small room bass indeed become bit much if think try applying following trick turn soundlink volume maximum time turn volume player accordingly as soudnlink reduces bass highest volume setting order avoid distortion notice trick treble bass fit together much better need additional eq settings etc for whatever reason i one anti bose people i flame like many seem really people life passion hatred bose need find new hobby i never purchased bose product today i guess i felt would signal i duped power marketing overspend something priced audiophiles lacking audiophile quality audio thank goodness i finally grown wise curmudgeonly enough care others think the soundlink delivers feature i looking time ear sound absolutely fantastic what i wanted small speaker kitchen i use music podcasts delivered via iphone ipad knowing apple updating iphone fall update likely include new dock connector format i want device soon obsolete appendage would take precious counter space but wireless must i want plug unplug device loose aux cable sitting counter speaker use my first inclination towards airplay i good experience using airplay appletv assumed bluetooth based speaker still word crap but much reading became clear compromise associated current crop airplay enabled speaker made non starter so i reluctantly began exploration bluetooth based speaker reading far many review trying number device person soundlink clearly stood apart sound design overall quality for anyone else market small wireless speaker i say best thing try device music amount exposition able truly capture thing sound ear feel hand on seeing trial ing soundlink v competitor like jawbone jambox logitech wireless boombox several philips unit decision brainer here quick take pro con pros i believe good thing sound bluetooth based audio streaming really come long way it get plenty loud remains impressively free distortion even uncomfortably loud volume i love warmth work gratingly harsh tinny speaker example violin concerto sound fantastic soundlink the size perfect small space like kitchen apartment balcony and though true portability via battery power one requisite nice any discussion design going subjective eye hand soundlink beautiful product category with exception jambox quite nicely designed well bluetooth speaker look like intended dorm room soundlink classic design hand work anywhere i willing wager still look great decade the built cover stand also clever useful cons the one i think price the soundlink quite bit expensive product category former bose skeptic convinced bose premium entirely justified least case fantastic speaker i set along audioengine s inch powered subwoofer audioengine s black inch powered subwoofer formerly i using bose companion speaker obviously audioengine blow bose away i also quite bose soundtouch i prefer audioengine a i use one set small bathroom without subwoofer if share wall neighbor might able use subwoofer much without subwoofer small bathroom bass sure strong enough taste much better subwoofer as see pic bit much fit

speaker but pair powered bookshelf unit i heard better see edit bottom review another update see edit update review i bought audioengine a speaker pc sound system based review i read review site well youtube review i profoundly disappointed sound either ear defective speaker defective everything i listened sound bad my favorite cds pandora youtube music video video game sound even voice youtube spoken video sound thin though played paper cone driver free air i literally turn favorite tune le minute listening sounded bad compared i used first i confirmed i speaker polarity correct sounded though i two speaker wired opposite polarity in fact i properly wired speaker using red right wiring rule thumb then i reversed polarity satellite speaker case one speaker wired backwards inside nope sounded even worse then i switched amp speaker case speaker cambridge soundworks sub opposite polarity nope either so i went back original red right wiring gave day readers may wonder i comparing a speaker my living room system comprises old good quality component b w cdm special edition floor standing speaker hsu tn cylinder sub the hsu hsu model power amp b ws driven adcom gfa ii i run adcom gfp preamp old incredibly heavy solid sony cd es cd player my turntable similarly ancient still excellent technics direct drive i expecting a speaker match volume frequency range living room system the high end maybe bass extension b ws what i expect excellent frequency balance low moderate sound level acceptable bass response reproducing music what i hear speaker sound though somebody adjusted low high frequency tone control scale go i think capable reproducing frequency range i expect tuned roll low high fwiw i play living room system tone control defeated my previous pc sound system cambridge soundworks system sounded quite nice given low cost the a speaker precise meaning i hear thing familiar song hidden cambridge system but cambridge system frequency balance pleasing ear for sure sound nothing like living room system annoying the audioengine a speaker sound annoying turn i bought inexpensive behringer graphic equalizer see i salvage a speaker if work i return and i never buy speaker without audition first edit one day later i really want like speaker since hardware equalizer arrive several day i decided try software equalizer using equalizer apo i adjusted frequency balance point i enjoying music the bad news took db adjustment reach goal i attached screen shot current setting edit one week later i carefully listening audioengine a speaker new behringer graphic equalizer with proper ear equalization sound good easy star maybe i added start rating a speaker capable pleasing sound quality i go higher star need lot equalization i still blown away every time i listen speaker i know computer speaker could sound good coming fairly good set klipsch pro media i say a step previous one the sound balance compared klipsch set bit bass heavy these speaker around good suitable kind music the white set i bought look great desk i recently bought a far sound great my problem i bring cel phone close pick interference sound an addition time time make pek sound fire cracker went does one problem i speaker month love pros great sound quality best bit comes everything box remote cable studio type speaker include great build quality cons these speaker seem emphasize midrange frequency bit sometimes sound bit soft lacking treble i comparing speaker m audio bx speaker i say much clear sound stage balanced bass response it bit unfair compare audioengines m audio bx audioengines computer speaker used virtually application bx studio monitor serve singular purpose reproducing sound close original source possible i following setup audioengines connected computer bx connected tv i would way i switched number occasion make sure i correct the reason i believe speaker sound better computer warm sound nice close especially computer setup the m audio bx sounded harsh closeup feel like computer speaker the second factor i believe audioengines better suited computer setup ease volume adjusted bx manual volume control unit lead unbalanced sound adjust volume correctly conclusion from experience sound system bose harmon kardon various studio monitor i believe best computer speaker buy price range they well built great overall sound i would definitely recommend speaker anyone interested buying speaker computer setup you disappointed update i knocking star fact mine developed crack split year see included photo these great powered amplified speaker really pack lot punch even subwoofer note however go hz want really deep impactful bass still need subwoofer i audioengine s subwoofer happy i think one could also happy speaker alone i audioengine a year quite happy paired audioengine s subwoofer i decided desktop pocketbook could afford larger speaker i really liked bamboo i know woodworking bamboo high quality sturdy wood plus design standpoint look great add decor in bamboo also look like expensive speaker i like fact use mdf i hate with a i instantly noticed smoother sound regard mids mostly since much larger speaker provide richer full range sound i quite happy purchase optional angled stand help point spearkers ear use working computer if using bookshelf stand probably needed since bottom come lined thick rubberized type foam now

definition dimensionality sound missing portable speaker i heard i listened owned quite although speaker come known potential issue i rate star sound quality alone other consumer expressed concern a internal battery if battery tends die longer hold charge relatively short time usage really unfortunate case replacing battery thing i think suggest hopefully tdk address problem like future a healthy battery allow roughly six hour playback six hour seem like much day but i think important take consideration amount juice take power device w output unusual speaker size probably least partially responsible great sound speaker capable producing well relatively short term total battery play time larger battery capacity usually mean larger expensive battery device le portability there always tradeoff most portable general size range run around w w total output also others use either passive radiator bass reflex port fatten bass output sort built equalization give illusion bass apart a i aware small battery powered portable speaker include built dedicated powered subwoofer even larger speaker like bose soundlink big jambox include powered sub personally i willing accept a limitation sound produce superior anything i yet heard speaker size reasonable price i paid way battery play time extended using external battery pack capable supplying volts i use anker astro pro mah multi voltage external battery probably option available the anker battery come cable fit a charging port i fiddle around bit i could get cable fit right work much time i content simply leave a plugged i

bluetooth capability tends distort higher volume level bulky easily portable the logitech boombox come close also considerably larger lack tightly defined full bass tdk seriously ear tdk add dimension sound entirely different level with speaker i constantly found scrambling adjust eq music player ipod classic laptop tablet get everything sound right with tdk a i seldom ever feel need tweak equalizer setting good my thanks took time leave review amazon customer feedback always big help i researching product update after purchasing speaker i became aware number portable feature powered subwoofer these include creative sound blaster roar sony srsx loewe speaker go although i perfectly satisfied performance tdk a option certainly seem worth checking one hardest thing i done lately trying pick quality bluetooth speaker aux input i critical listener budget mean i always looking maximum performance minimum outlay sadly almost every wireless speaker i able demo person sounded like garbage one way another priced far higher i willing pay truly entire concept getting natural flat sound something tiny jambox a practically impossible task so little surprise first tryout speaker rather disappointing right box charged sounded incredibly muffled overly bass heavy from intial strictly sound quality standpoint definitely one star product luckily entire story edit after getting use speaker extensively road i upgrade sound quality rating three star still good i hoping better aligned overall rating i found i needed little eq fiddling watching tv show online video like this week in tech they sound fine it music need lot help this speaker feel like touch smaller large jambox speaker rage today it quite heavy size however feel like made quality material outside good quality speaker inside the recessed touch control top unit well weighted require foce activate sensitive easily changed carried around the led backlighting button bright diffused distracting dimly lit room the side port hidden rubber grommet slot place maintain water resistence use of course work using bluetooth feature cabled charger plugged using usb jack charge phone lose protection finally small plastic kickstand bottom flip angle speaker slightly it rather flimsy break unless abused i really like design heft it small enough toss weekend bag take hotel trip big enough fill average sized room plenty sound i occasion turn way loud even moderate volume bass pronounced battery life far clocked around six hour use course day that adequate class leading in addition power button top unit master power switch rubber grommet used extend battery charge i used switch every time unit turned i tested leaving standby i imagine would yield significantly shorter run time even though unit appears one odd note unit emitted rather unusual smell first us the best way describe new electronics smell japanese product only made china but definitely peculiar unpleasant odor first updated on bluetooth front range around claimed foot outdoors little le indoors i able pair speaker two different device far issue even though i disappointed sound quality i still rating high nice design fact feel pretty solidly built i like battery replaced necessary i able download sound eq program phone mp player rockbox software great eq well helped bring speaker life really sound great so need compact powerful speaker like lot bass size eq toy flatten level portable speaker serve well all music sound output review correct good portable speaker better indoors i borrowed bose soundlink ii compared side side honestly like unit price the difference bose vocal like singer front stringed instrument detailed hear le bass high it us mah ni mh battery expect soon battery capacity go volume automatically make choke sound like actually like unit reset see volume drop light bar depends battery drain specially music bass i like change aa size nimh battery mah someday make hole underneath connecting better li type last island beach beer bbq overall last nearly hour crank volume max bluetooth source songza app ipad mini started choke mentioned the usb it work unit plugged charged other useless hopefully use update thing like music enhancement mystery designer care add one want charge gadget better use original charger conveniently i thought i try tdk a alternative bose soundlink i always satisfied the a even quite bit smaller weight soundlink i like form factor a weight bit annoying limiting real portability also battery life could longer at moderate volume able squeeze hour soundlink play hour level usually enough day beach i test long speaker would last near maximum volume recharging completely empty device took hour the a round full sound it bass heavy soundlink sound clearer impression something missing sound enough bass enjoyable improved quite bit good positioning i would preferred slightly lower tuned bass the tdk play hz fall sharply hz hear anything soundlink play well hz i compared soundlink tdk a quite lot i like deeper bass soundlink sometimes sound bass playing besides without integration rest music bose applying lot processing bass sometimes even sound bit artificial i track clearly hear additional bass overtone present original recording the a seem push bass strong sound overall natural the soundlink also much directional treble response positioned well might sound dull muffled this problem pronounced tdk still missing bass power soundlink bit i think bass response bose tdk would perfect taste the tdk a even play quite bit louder soundlink sound clean anymore it seems bass limiter higher level distort even highest volume bass sound clean anymore the soundlink disort even highest level hear lot dynamic compression going bass reduced well at high level notch maximum say one sound better the soundlink sound cleaner tdk seems dynamic louder i noticed quirk like built usb port charging device speaker attached main make usb port rather useless portable use i could also hear short bit previous track everytime skipped next track become quite annoying sometimes problem occured far experience bluetooth drop out strange behaviour at tdk cost half soundlink make real bargain brainer one decide two my complaint weaker battery life heavy weight speaker still vibrate quite heavily dance around fall depending surface apart a nice toy great sound competes easily bigger speaker like big jambox logitech z i tempted video review side side comparison soundlink i soundlink ii said done sound matter way convey unless preview sound difference live that said assessment comparing two yes sound quite bit fuller yet better balanced improvement mids high w crisper sound top end without beginning tinny hissy overly blaring another reviewer stated treble diminished sl ii i hearing differently from big brassy sound era sinatra edge u guitar actually get nice shimmering mid range treble the bass solid expansive without exaggerated there time sound feel like i got dedicated floor standing subwoofer i look i reminded sound come something bigger hardcover book some reviewer said hear little difference soundlinks i ii so i add point you probably hear difference sound quality soundlink i ii play wide variety different musical genre i if read hundred soundlink i review amazon hear one consistent theme mid range high soundlink i sound muddy muffled especially compared big jambox while i hear difference soundlink i still provides pleasant listening experience if soundlink ii exist i happy soundlink i at time improvement sound quality sounndlink ii i believe address concern voice concern i like bi fold cover allows easily carry unit around house playing with sl i cover would hanging awkwardly wanted walk across living room playing music battery indicator light provides information battery status going green yellow red by way important tip anyone wanting make objective comparison soundlink portable speaker remember soundlink passive subwoofer project backwards whether comparing something feature keep soundlink away wall otherwise would get disproportionately boomy bass many complained i think one little detail inadvertently perhaps unfairly negatively skewed soundlink review personally time i like close wall music sound live way matter taste all side i lived soundlink week impression likes big well balanced sound small form factor like book easy carry bluetooth pair easily versatility you also connect via wire new bifold cover allows easier carrying playing music minimalist design i like fact software baggage remove control computerized voice deal gives break wear ipod earbuds time dislikes battery life long others category no volume reading while easy adjust volume cannot tell volume setting relative highest lowest setting ac adapter seems bigger need distasteful overly expensive cover overall sound better system dedicated floor subwoofer i heard also i admit i heard big jambox hard imagine would turn folk camp particularly smaller portable sl form factor when i back component system heyday i sherwood amplifier receiver turntable cassette deck two giant speaker inch woofer today i carrying big sound around house room room time even playing music i used play what trip thanks bose i rather critical speaker product son audio engineer close follower bose past decade half this product suffers bose distinct hollowness result compromise use four identical speaker attempting produce entire spectrum sound to fair bose competitor thing i suppose i expected bit given price tag essentially bluetooth pcb battery amplifier speakers i actually quite surprised volume review amazon expensive product overwhelming amount star review i could help think product different rest characteristic emptiness every region vocal mid range upper end mid bass region the treble output abysmal clarity crispness the bass practically non existent fact review well known site commented rich bass something i quite looking forward what disappointment without instrumentation relying solely ear i would say product exhibit rather peaky fr curve steep drop around upper end mid range dipping around upper end mid bass along lower freq fr curve keep mind halfway decent sounding system able make type ascertation e sound performance linear enough would require sampling using sort professional hardware software draw fr curve find real peak valley exist i return though actually perform somewhat well understand exactly buying compact speaker system expected compromise dedicated household speaker system even ipod dock it incredibly loud given size product tinge audible bass back late needed boombox x size d cell sized battery get level performance yeah i setting expectation so half bad outdoor setting say open sea yacht bbq open setting would cancel bass home speaker system e missing low frequency sound soundlink ii would dedicated subwoofer it also highly portable see posted photo given something could powerful enough work outdoors provided competing sound system area so expect much conveniently sized decent battery life loudspeaker designed producing narrow band frequency response curve favor hardware component used four tiny driver would constitute good sound world mid range vocal region fr curve i difficulty pairing variety bt device in experience rechargeable speaker i think majority interested portable self powered bluetooth speaker thoroughly satisfied impressed soundlink ii expectations i came speaker expecting performance speaker size shape i wrong expectation from beginning i knew unit different heavy relatively speaking speaker size way many bose speaker only fire customary heavy feel make sense i kept eye close jawbone jambox wireless bluetooth speaker black diamond retail packaging ended one first impressions from opening box unit heavier expected also thinner expected picture i adding picture charging took hour usable

jaw dropping tiny size way make want feel touch flip thing around see bass coming you even feel normal vibration bass make even shocking i actually grin face first time i started testing unit shock great sound range the volume tremendous sound could easily fill room host room party goer provide background music might even want turn bit my thought bose i new bose i bose companion multimedia

i enthusiastic bluetooth speaker it good drawbacks so far i discovered two drawback first power adapter bit oblong far wall brick concerned i found unplugging accidentally time first couple hour i using this one small inconvenience i rated speaker star instead second unit heavy maybe worth weight make sound great battery life good shocked pick brick overall conclusion i still exploring battery life far every aspect speaker great it premium product premium price i think disappointed if particular question i always happy answer comment update i see unhelpful vote pretty uncommon if find thought unhelpful please post note discussion help improve meet expectation first let say speaker smaller i anticipated knowing going small i small hand still fit palm hand easily sound the sound unit good considering size bass higher volume bit pop thud i picky distort point poor sound there slot across back look see passive radiator help aid bass reproduction do place speaker flat wall covering port negative impact sound quality the quality sound par speaker cost double size tiny price going price feature great price bluetooth connection bluetooth simple turn speaker open bluetooth iphone connect done the speakerphone option handy warned answer automatically it actually harder get packaging connect bluetooth update battery the battery lasted almost full work day i turned hour day lunch that better i expected note battery get low speaker begin gripe special tone i heard tone time speaker quit playing go pretty fast it would seem standard gripe otherwise great little speaker built wire i agree i got mine today i impressed however limited wire if look product specification listed see input connection addition integral cable say x mm stereo jack that right folk another way what need mm male male cable i tried soon mine arrived yesterday work well better built wire the best part get one like amazon well place uncommon cable the sound seems reasonable small mono speaker sufficient need unit edit update battery life hour stop playing give quiet little chirpy tone telling done i sure first i soon figured i mine bit louder medium i guessing might timer something protecting battery running completely edit my earlier second update month ago disappeared fyi speaker making chirpy noise ipod shuffle apparently ipod full blast drain battery much faster would say three click back full i never heard ipod run juice normally last much longer i charge run hence confusion subsequently speaker lasted longer hour ipod slightly reduced output i bought set banana plug work perfectly trial error installation attempt i found trouble free way put together so i use awg wire speaker i honestly think would work anything bigger unless small casing wire i started stripping casing wire i poke bare wire thru center plug much thru plug extend thread mushroom bare wire tip th seems sweet spot installgear gauge awg ft speaker wire true spec soft touch cable seems work exceptionally well plug i older rca awg speaker wire thick casing difficult push thru plug casing still i i want go waste i stripped casing get wire thru plug these work pain get wire i got one side hole my mistake don get the one without it also enough channel setup but i take l good banana plug only complaint difficult use awg wire does job i know three peices per plug i found bottom peice researching put together i gave three star i go manufacturer website see put together found sell cheaper i attach picture show others put together last step screw top back last picture sorry bad screen writing also anyone fired tip removable let know i still sound reasoning perfectly fine setup the easiest way terminate speaker wire strip end push hole fold wire tighten screw back done and way get stray wire exposed i recently wired little finished basement system wanted nice wall plate make everything look clean i also wall mount surround speaker perfect finishing wire end it end little expensive wire i end i clean finished system wire showing if i ever need move undo anything i unplug quickly easily it also nice i break apart expensive copper wall wiring screwing end post yes work excellent quality and look nice consideration connection visible see video instruction others posted wonder connect wire take easy effective secure nice easy assemble if anyone worried paperclip whatever conductor shorting connector remember clear shrink tubing friend i week happy combination quality price i bought banana plug i wanting replace bare wire speaker connection back receiver i wanted cleaner look well making easier come time disconnect thing setup simple i went monoprice youtube page view short instructional video since i used type connector had initial trouble i figured i bought monoprice copper speaker banana plugs closed screw type paired suggestion amazon deciding buy monster cable xp compact high performance clear jacket speaker wire ft hoping two would work well together i spent last two hour least reading assembly suggestion buyer trying several method squeeze gauge monster speaker cable much smaller hole back color coded ring banana plugs so beware avoid anything larger gauge i finally manage assemble four cable stripping back thick jacket least inch then using pair heavy duty linesman pliers soft cloth wrapped around back end banana plugs i pushed hand damage cable least half inch jacket hole leaving half inch stripped bare wire exposed threaded end next spreading wire strand i started screwing half plug part never unscrewed holding back end pair heavy duty linesman pliers soft cloth wrapped around also using another pair lightweight plier also soft cloth several turn completely assembled i seriously thought trying find different brand banana plugs may suited monster cable xp compact high performance clear jacket gauge speaker wire especially new tube amplifier arriving tomorrow even spending ridiculous amount faster shipping get time really sure would work easier i decided try make fit so hopefully sometime tomorrow i back good news newly assembled speaker cable work perfectly first try update the new tube amplifier arrived half hour ago monster speaker wire monoprice copper speaker banana plugs combination seems working quite well i added new photo showing plugged back amp seem secure far i plan removing often ever sure yet start become loose time unplugged these made installation much easier cleaner looking hooking wire bare these working well make back end receiver look nice i used gauge wire holding together fine its really brainer left picture i plug installed see ugly look these plug heavy the look feel pretty good using b w speaker qed cable no complaint these open screw type easy install cable nice i love i wish speaker accepted my pioneer look like post screw terminal fake hole end when i picked jbl micro wireless speaker two year ago i looking audiophile level sound reproduction i looking speaker loud enough compete jet engine i looking something could conveniently replace mediocre phone speaker time place low cost the jbl micro wireless couple pleasant surprise sleeve sound signature its ok will mind blown no will pleasantly surprised yes highs present little blown detailed however problem causally listening detract heavily overall experience mids mediocre they sound recessed often muddled clarity hard come song bass pleasant surprise i mentioned earlier when speaker directly facing noticeable amount bass accurate enough casual listening this help provide level depth micro wireless i expect sound projection exactly one would expect flat laying speaker when pointed directly almost mids bass cut leaving upper frequency audible this bad annoying song accidentally move speaker field accuracy it also worth noting higher volume noticeable thinning sound distortion while noticeable loud room annoying need volume boost far away battery life battery life good compact speaker it lasted five hour test coming hour minute continual bluetooth playback charging rather quick needing hour finish charging battery connectivity connectivity micro wireless also pretty good bluetooth connectivity work intended cut around foot unobstructed there also mm jack allowing turn set speaker bluetooth speaker this work using micro wireless receiver passing signal via mm jack whatever sound system want you also daisy chain several micro wireless way there also mm jack would rather connect micro wireless analog durability the micro wireless pretty durable built sturdy plastic shell need worry kinetic damage the speaker grill make hard metal i presume aluminum it perforated small hole water particulate able fall i would recommend taking beach after year use visible paint wear discoloration aside power button legend wearing away slightly the volume control seems form water resistance i messing lot hand wet since official documentation water resistance i could lucky as i recommend handling hand wet portability this speaker stupid portable it light sort thin fit jean pocket if i want take micro wireless event need ride bike speaker perfect there also felt

line cable easily connect speaker clip cool useful feature a bit small side it stand even highest volume cool music point putting jbl table battery performing great far i quantify many hour charge fast last very happy super portable speaker come everywhere i got lightning deal price two glass wine main hey bluetooth speaker i would definitely recommend this quality product the insulation covering wire made silicone the wire stranded end wire platinum plated worry corrosion oxidation and yes copper oxidize thus reduce signal voltage going speaker they say copper oxygen free i way

subwoofer twitter micca i recommend excellent power w usa there many bad review speaker price range plus host unknown chinese brand i wanted make sure i got brand known high quality lead cerwin vega i

really nice fact i one love scoop mids much scooping needed make happy since mids quite satisfying year warranty company owned gibson the main speaker contains amplifier get warm hot nice i sure thermal protection circuit i going ask cerwin would bet cerwin vega speaker always top notch quality design hardware the system auto standby kick minute speaker detecting audio you know standby since glowing red ring around volume go power still to get speaker standby must send audio signal take second speaker wake the speaker wake elegantly without pop crackle snap nice another attribute showing great quality speaker the standby mode great feature i feel like turning speaker night standby amplifier disconnect cool all i compared mackie m audio presonus others decided cerwin vega i could happier enjoy good quality cable will buy well i must say i pleasantly surprised sound quality i get brand speaker wire i bought three set foot foot foot subwoofer i tried well produced album like fleetwood mac tango night metal album distorted heavy bass metal collection there crispness sound wider range capturing sound i hear cds vinyl very impressive even jbl speaker year old unlike others i experience issue problem screw banana plug i highly recommend product these simply awesome speaker cable i amp banana plug speaker without i prepared simply cut end what a bonus cable pair setscrew inside banana plug opposed soldered crimp making completely removable installable i ever buy new speaker banana plug how cool so indeed thick cable many supposedly i count tiny real copper wire i saw many cable copper plated aluminum well copper rather expensive day sound quality place skimp with many small wire cable stiff i audiophile i swear i hear difference ok fact i replaced twisted pair silver colored pa wire might effect seriously really quite awesome cable completely happy i bought five two main speaker biamping one center channel my primary speaker b w cm s i prefer biamping since copper finely stranded cable easy manage easily kink they come properly packaged loop wound tight like cheap cable leaving straighten de kink wire this gauge wire far larger people used seeing speaker wire it probably bigger really necessary i like i want awesome speaker using larger gauge minimize loss signal degradation even signal travel six foot the banana fit snugly speaker receiver extremely long shell i like look banana cable see photo as others noted soldered bonded fancy mean screw securing wire banana plug this bother fact i like i easily repair replace connector ever become necessary the outer shell screw banana cable worked loose half cable shipping if happens screw done these new favorite speaker cable i wish sewell sold wire spool shorter foot if i buy hand maybe i call beg anyway buy cable if kind audiophile training give good sound make feel good wiring system beefy cable people look proclaim holy cow im currently replacing original yamaha polk entry small speaker came yamaha htr i known polk year father small tower convinced upgrade originally purchased t canceled order seeing inch speaker v dollar piece my gripe think inch wolfers would better design port the speaker way deeper measured furniture movement luckily turned ok these speaker loud bounce around sound incredibly from movie great music i bought phenomenal money i shocked got sound like dollar pair speaker easily update polk center inch sub pictured pol way surround the pride joy living room lol this really pleasant departure pioneer ts g r speaker i previously running rear first little backstory my previous pioneers way result weakness midrange when came bass high excelled compared speaker price range but constant annoyance strain ear hear vocal overshadowed distorted bass at one point i ts g rs front rear i upgraded front speaker sony xs gtx speaker way lessen lack midrange music it helped little bit even i sat front midrange sounded rather soft after blowing speaker rear i decided upgrade rear time i knew i want way anymore pioneer speaker exceptional range although good pioneer claim the ts g rs frequency response like hz i found way ordered these speaker frequency response like hz my sonys front frequency response hz these work best powered w w rms make fine use headunits except pyramid pyle legacy boss sound storm planet audio jensen audiovox dual axxera ironically pioneer it sound fine any headunit sound best within power range i installed speaker afternoon i comment durability quite yet however i noticed balance sound back system i struggle hear word song anymore in addition bass kicking without muddied competing midrange the high also sound bit detailed true although basshead i great ear treble a lot similar speaker especially polk db speaker rockford fosgate p speaker competing price point around way speaker chance low mids battling causing distortion both polk rockford fosgate well known making exceptional speaker i wish would offer kind way inch speaker rockford fosgate speaker like prime series speaker i looking punch series way discontinued i believe i saying way better i feel one speaker like least way that way speaker focus three key area sound low mids high component dedicated one key basically way speaker woofer handling bass tweeter handling treble midrange split shared woofer tweeter with way woofer handle low midrange driver handle mids tweeter take care high way really much better way woofer low midrange mids high split two tweeter so i guess i trying say looking speaker willing sacrifice little dough would entry level speaker go speaker the frequency response even realistically always best pioneer speaker this speaker like nearly pioneer speaker slimmest allowing installation even shallowest location these speaker produce satisfying full range sound full bass clear mids accurate treble i always found pioneer product clear winner competitor similarly priced product i also running speaker pioneer deh mp headunit chosen blew away competitor i even considering replacing sony xs gtx speaker pioneer ts a r way speaker i update review i notice problem i way pair back slot ford fusion sound awesome my stock speaker bad took base well compared crap japanese car speaker these way sow full range i missing my stock speaker seemed bit high getting right tune these way point so buy speaker regret eventually i load rest speaker slot i sub woofer already otherwise meant bass booming add something sub altogether i received speaker earlier today i cannot comment battery length but i tell thing feel solid durable the sound amazing clear sound great general the bass sound good super amazing obviously giant subwoofer attached i guess cannot unrealistic expectation size speaker impressed also thing go loud joke my pc speaker even compete thing huge speaker also sound good speaker either also sound great quite worry now compare last bluetooth speaker sol republic brand and thing blow water with crasher slim cut connected via bluetooth like sol speaker also similar price i got sol republic punk bluetooth speaker i loved jlab earbuds many year great quality speaker i update i issue i keep rocking update i still love speaker i never connectivity issue like review via bluetooth the battery last long time i still bit disappointed lack bass it great speaker seems durable little brother borrows often and let say treat electronics well i still would recommend i would say star speaker lack bass but i would still recommend i picked local ross store major discount amazon listing

offer promise in faq how little speaker great bass post it also worth mentioning use enhancement circuit add fake bass youll hear real bass really low clean great right but review a i saw attached graph output woofer red trace very manipulated so give i emailed first response thanks reaching u neither original a a bass boosting circuit built hmm i already told engineer a indeed circuit non defeatable so i ask second response both a a include compensation amplifier lower frequency either what mean faq a a separate dedicated dsp circuit designed specifically enhance bass like audio product while people sure happy result tool purist come stuff like avoid tampering source audio much possible hope make sense so audioengine claiming simplistic analog boost circuit qualify undesirable enhancement circuit sophisticated true dsp circuit and approach expression purist what load bs that downright comical and huge fat lie many best studio monitor e g genelec employ dsp it

i ride train berth reminded kitchen i little skeptical two thing first true portability the speaker fairly compact square x deep but solid meaning couple pound when i throw purse i notice weight it noticeably heftier jambox though superior sound quality make i deduct star wanted note i also note battery life esquire roughly equivalent jambox hr drain full charge but main concern conferencing system i tested quite get work i think device broken i think instruction bad i add instruction manual quick start guide series picture given many country language harmon kardon support seems reverted hieroglyphic when i searched online complete instruction manual hk website i found nothing so i deducted star conference calling feature easy enough someone internet access google savviness deduce in opinion lack instructional documentation problem device design clear enough make i bluetooth speaker best sound also twice others cost but worth sound i check bluetooth speaker earbuds live recording joni mitchell free man paris jaco pastorious bass pat metheny guitar i saw jaco live alive know sound so i test this reproduces good frequency reproduction across spectrum better others but probably best sound come little acoustic guitar sound play turn pair so tell i getting right tone recording bluetooth speaker i tested direct line yet might create better reproduction so pain butt first connect automatically i turn like come klipsch that brainer second show battery level top iphone like others also pretty simple option add finally pain turn i using it however turn automatically i unpair phone i know long take i know i come back nice accessory travel abroad couple nice storage bag speaker accessory included plus all i pretty happy sound i wish i manually pair phone every time i use the harman kardon onyx wireless speaker system thing beauty you sense quality moment begin open packaging i love design brushed stainless steel loop form single foot speaker handle the round shape look organic black cloth grill black leather back make look rich home decor the sound quality system exceptional size considering get true stereo separation component one cabinet this trade make portability for place i going system set permanently i space like office attached computer i still prefer harman kardon soundsticks le half price speaker system but combination portability sound system going hard beat the harman kardon onyx wireless speaker system ridiculous number way connect music source wireless and really point buying system wireless connectivity one pet peeve buying

getting bose sl speaker case extra protection purchasing carry around bag worth protect investment i hope get many year speaker make awesome memory well aloha fyi my picture includes case i purchased separately bose well really happy speaker almost every nuance would recommend anyone sounds good enough definitely upgrade stock i delighted find fit honda civic dx hondas usually screw speaker whereas reasonable car manufacturer use i also bought correct wiring adapter literally minute install pair metra speaker wire adapters select honda vehicles total adapters very good sound not best ever excellent price exactly expected nice speaker wire the wire sleeve soft making easy work one side red line the cable work expected but i think may confusion regarding cca i attempt clear i expert take i say grain salt these cable cca copper clad aluminum aluminium mostly aluminum thin coating copper this important aluminum conduct electricity much le effectively copper almost le efficient higher resistance and painting wire copper may slightly enhance aluminum wire still pure copper wire thus cannot enjoy benefit before buying cable understand important difference pure copper wiring aluminum wiring cca assuming cable structurally well built likely audible difference two however aluminum wiring degrades much faster much plyable prone snapping greater malleability meaning wire literally melt pressure oxidizes faster reducing conductivity cca cable good short term year indoor installation temperature frequent temperature fluctuation wreck aluminum strand snap within cable cut conductivity its good temporary cheap solution audio cable if wall installation need cl cl rated cable made purpose lastly quality installation audio equipment i would personally go pure copper stranded cable low gauge the oxygen free cable ofc thing marketing term all copper cable already oxygen free like cabling standard oxygen free term adding literally le oxygen free charging large premium le purity overall great guage speaker wire it good balance flex still allowing shape running around corner getting lay flat it retain spool shape even near core spool once come spool easy straighten the wire i received different official picture it lettering wire instead black stripe i pretty easy time laying wire see stripe along wall however would really preferred subtle method marking negative wire whole point buying white wire blend wall an ultra light grey stripe would ideal i used definitive technology speaker setup everything sound fantastic expected if running banana plug wire fairly thin look bad coming back about small i recommend going running along wall unobtrusively without sacrificing sound quality due undesired resistance attached photo show wire design change so i get price perfect better bose soundlink mini ii works perfectly ipad pc windows phone touch button ok thought worse no lag playing video ipad device haven tested yet speakerphone i i

crisp easy read even font look quite small k resolution i three k monitor dell ultrasharp inch asus inch philips inch monitor i learned inch monitor big bright gave bad headache virtually blinding i trying sell even though work perfectly so i decided inch monitor optimum desktop monitor but i use benq inch monitor i realize also good size i bring closer offset font size small so shallow desk ideal size everything exceptionally crisp detail k resolution equal time resolution hd monitor television this also first tn panel type i know anything the main upside ultrafast msec response time ideal gaming i gamer even though tempting today fast overclocked computer super fast monitor like benq monitor i approaching year old i want wasting little time i remaining earth playing game my wife much younger maybe waste time gaming compared ips panel tn panel doesnt great viewing angle however person using time doesnt matter you looking dead center look perfect ive noticed i walk toward desk side monitor face obviously extreme angle i approach white background noticeable yellow color even thinking notice it expecting but i sit directly front tn monitor bright white color excellent like ips display panel other color monitor also change shade appear little faded extreme angle viewing i person us monitor extreme angle viewing consequence if two people seated next front monitor able see background white color start appear faint yellow color lot get much wider viewing angle however response time much better ips panel really fast action gaming this display highly desirable feature called high dynamic range hdr emulated hardware based the point hdr deep black bright white present source video without washing blended together however cannot create something nothing if source

monitor the brand look horrible blue light reduction a better description very low contrast extremely faded image maybe lot le blue light difficult read turn monitor resulting light in comparison benq reasonable step blue light reduction especially reading mode it probably prevent headache plan reading lot text one time however convenient fumble menu get monitor back way normally use i think i ever

screen size smaller doesnt generate blinding amount light until i purchased inch monitor never occurred much bright light would emit it expensive i tortured almost year i gave bought inch monitor what difference made headache reduction and going inch i expect reduce eye strain headache even bigger always better ironically i researching high end monitor several month still i leaning toward benq made purchase yet i needed low end monitor station came across monitor i read review seems either get good one bad one in case i got good one it excellent monitor price point i admit i impressed this designer monitor mean claim as graphic designer i would recommend monitor but average user great buy i plugged monitor dead pixel even opened photoshop check see even color white screen the type large readable though sharp the resolution x advertised usually standard inch monitor account text crystal sharp large readable this monitor used coding if want sharp text need x one color correctness good perfect facebook slightly darker blue screen actually pictures show great far color accurate the button back front monitor ideal the refresh rate feel great quirk first button back right mean put directly another monitor ideal multimonitor setup next slow respond far input swapping powering sleep mode worse still need thing happen instance input set pc asleep want wake swap gaming device like second process brutal i would love give display star review the color look great seems responsive gaming joy there glare everything look good i reducing star specific reason first thing adjustable silly honest opinion the real kicker display really really ticked i first powered thing already dead pixel line across screen pixel wide talk huge let not sure i ever buy another benq monitor solely reason disappointing see included photo bought replace current monitor color distortion primary use old one secondary monitor let say nd monitor best thing ever set simple difference beyond compare

device v dc power adapter input connect ac dc power supply battery capacity indicator depending color determine remaining capacity battery indicator important access actual battery reading ground control app accuracy pair audio source effortless i issue either note phone ak ii dap at first i thought nfc would good option later discussion riva i realized due small footprint proximity sensor top nfc implementation feasible once paired i issue wireless connection across open space foot sound quality impressive deserves separate section review since talking true audiophile quality performance and support popular sbc aac aptx audio wireless codecs actually top notch audio hardware design since i android based aptx codec support important transparency transmitted digital audio meaningless without quality amplifier driver deliver audio interpretation ear before i go deeper audio analysis let talk little bit riva remote control app call ground control app there premium speaker come companion setup apps usually limited mostly setup functionality here dealing control app cover everything usually i prefer leave phone source alone control music directly speaker transport control available part using rugged speaker outside keeping phone sight since i found riva turbo x appropriate indoor use role reversed i looking opportunity fire ground control app you get everything precise battery reading every touch button access including large volume wheel even playback control play pause track skip though using native audio playback app rd party support yet and want customization go setting change speaker name app background control favorite switch audio prompt voice tone the thing make better add sound audio prompt option finally im getting actual sound i reviewed lot different wireless speaker including number i consider smartphone accessory with exception detailed audio analysis simply necessary speaker since nothing special sound with riva turbo x even getting sound analysis look closer actual internal design appreciate much speaker offer unlike speaker use shelf generic headphone driver riva pack adx speaker starting three adx mm full range proprietary driver look like cleverly placed one front middle two side complimenting also four adx custom dual piston bass radiator two facing front two facing back pretty much speaker bass radiator way around rivas compact footprint but speaker part equation driving power speaker proprietary adx channel amplifier watt rms power control advanced dsp this amount power higher i ever seen bluetooth wireless speaker category keep mind power necessary mean louder sound actually corresponds enough juice drive speaker full undistorted potential and enough riva includes two override mode trillium surround enhances separation sound d imaging turbo eq mode boost db loudness level surround enhancement noticeable sound rather natural gimmicky dsp effect this mode perfect watching movie playing video game though i also enjoyed playing music lot sound detail got new d placement space turbo take sound overdrive it definitely useful max volume need squeeze dbs riva extra db kick without distortion thanks smart compressor this turbo effect might necessary lower volume especially since drain battery quite significantly want fill bigger room powerful sound activate turbo overdrive uninterrupted hour sound bliss unfortunately take hefty battery penalty possible keep plugged sound analysis i found riva turbo x impressive audiophile quality performance full body smooth balanced sound just like pro speaker sound quality benefit greatly speaker placement take advantage natural acoustic room as matter fact riva even includes suggestion speaker placement maximize performance after closer listening i found turbo x articulate low end fast mid bass punch deep sub bass texture bass clear detailed well controlled minimum spillage lower mids mids overall warm clear they thicker sound especially lower mids help building foundation full body sound upper mids clear detailed bright analytical vocals powerful organic delivery treble smooth warm extend far still capture enough detail soundstage good surround trillium mode expand staging new d width depth dimension layering separation typical speaker necessary best even bit congested standing close but take step back sound open fill room detailed presentation i think important factor order appreciate speaker quality sound perception go take step back like regular full size wired speaker another interesting thing riva audio actually encourage compare turbo x speaker competition you know encouragement come confidence product and tell truth every right brag i tested number hd speaker i feel come sound quality feature riva turbo x stand ahead competition for example braven hd sound colored muddy bass also loud powerful level clarity heavier weight le battery endurance advantage rugged design ue boom still among favorite power class come sound nice mid bass punch sub bass support sound thinner cant fill whole room battery hr though crazy standby powered lasting month limited app though better splash proof design b w t impressed build quality sound colored greater level distortion facing speaker otherwise sound get muffled even matter corner room place rather height level bose soundlink iii another good candidate comparison though i find bass deeper muddy side mention spillage lower mids comparison sound warmer lack level detail retrieval didnt chance test beoplay a yet one interesting comparison well summary overall i impressed performance riva turbo x audiophile quality design behind speaker active passive inside one compact enclosure w channel amp dsp processing surround sound mode turbo boost mode hour battery life aptx support firmware upgradeable charge port charge device touch control button proximity sensing led indicator polished ground control remote app mouthful bluetooth wireless speaker is absolute perfection maybe exterior design would little rugged way implement transport control speaker aside speaker could considered perfection long keep indoors careful handling actually lack transport control longer bother ground control app truly fun use but important thing pair source hit play longer hearing music actually feeling i think i say bluetooth wireless speaker i tested far cool versatile speaker i clarify not bluetooth i clarify i thought problem since work great it good sound clear crispy phone connects right small little cable still need recharged even though bluetooth it advantage i see brings optional cable connected another speaker type connected several speaker time better sound wish it rather small easy carry around it expandable bass resonator work smartphones

rub ajax know avail these speaker exposed rain general wind may blow time time this houston area lot humidity i outdoor speaker never discolored poorly may want consider black speaker putting outside rusty yellow color really look ugly white color otherwise good speaker chose speaker w sound i went local retail store listened along kicker pyle polk bose klipsch i would say sounded best price obviously group better sounding speaker also cost x money i found yamaha good sound price i took advantage used pricing amazon the speaker looked brand new came original box paperwork protective wrapping i assume return slightly damaged box one thing i liked previous model bracket pivot long edge rather short edge previous model my mount required mount long edge allow mount roof older model would forced mound wall house point downward bad angle i mounted back house used monoprice awg wire hook one run ft amp ft going quality heavy gauged wire important i powering speaker sonos amp speaker would compatible music throughout house the reason i gave star due fact speaker retail i able get le amazon retail price i think would better spending slightly getting different brand the low leave lot desired i party loud music back patio i played couple test song lot bass speaker even go low i would liked cover broader frequency response however polk atrium go low yamaha spec sheet i thought yamaha better bass atrium i understand hard get good bass non ported speaker add outside make much worse easy install in fact i yr old help looks great sturdy clean plate good design nice layout includes subwoofer port all port identified i run hdmi cable plate instead running directly receiver tv produced better signal way it plate i pulled hdmi plate behind tv run cable directly tv since plate also caused drop signal quality it might issue i running foot hdmi cable redmere technology powered might enough power run plate cable only issue otherwise excellent plate work gang wall insert amazon recommends onq legrand ac gang low voltage bracket retrofit i actually yet find gang screw line hence star update per experience s wells comment operator error gang insert issue to make plate work recommended wall insert remove plate cover module first screw module gang insert mount cover plate i add fifth star first x really seems like direct competitor bose soundlink mini even quite comparable sizewise sony slightly higher otherwise nearly matching soundlink mini last milimeter soundwise matter taste you bear mind sound best lower level maximum volume both play loudness really sound well top level introducing lot obvious dynamic limiting without much bass left surprising looking small driver cannot move enough air really high loudness so looking speaker wake neighbour look something else but looking small speaker nevertheless give full range sound comfortable listening level sony beside bose might best choice while still many claim jbl charge ue boom sound considerably better soundlink mini wishful thinking i tried side side maybe klipsch gig came bit closer soundlink mini others still league now sony srs x seems first really compete soundwise finally even beat bose the sony extremely clear treble especially directly compared bose sound rather muffled the problem treble rather thin sound pretty harsh especially particular recording i even tried wrapping sony cloth tame treble little bit on hand biggest problem bose strong directional treble dispersion the overall sound suffered considerably soundlink mini aimed directly towards listener the sony problem much you even turn around backwards still clearer treble bose it mids bose render fuller better piano sound vocal etc sound bit lost thin sony bass even slightly deeper sony surprising usually bose king big bass small speaker sony take even slightly pushing bass response hz indeed surprising speaker size the bose boomy bass sony roll hz make bass sound deep punchy sometimes give impression playing along beside music good thing sony sound boomy even placed corner hear deep bass drone buzz unlike bose sound good smaller room placed near wall for casual listening home lower volume level i would definitely choose sony bose might seem like blasphemy really low level i even preferred x highly rated sonos play cannot keep great sound level within first volume range the sony le critical positioning although sound better placed directly edge surface deeper inside middle table driver close base cause reflection base result combfilter effect mostly affect mids it better either elevate speaker slightly put small box underneath tilt upwards place edge avoid problem but outside listening i still prefer bose the boomier bass indeed advantage outdoors come better deeper bass sony rather get lost especially ambient noise present outdoors help lot place sony near back wall i always avoided bose but also thin treble might sound sizzling outdoors bose sound clearer especially due better defined mids despite duller muffled sound but lower treble uppder mids become obvious noisy enviroments seem bit missing sony a hi hat bose always glare bit mids sony rather present upper frequency maybe bose really tried tune soundlink mini especially outdoor listening sound better like indoors other difference might important charge sony standard micro usb connection need proprietary charger bose but time soundlink mini seems considerably stronger battery built when fooling around sony turning max see much handle happened le hour maximum volume dropped half charge light started flash sony i turn louder anymore turn completely turn notice maximum volume dropped minute the bose play hour top volume i sure get promised hour sony lower level i able get even hour bose listening similar volume the sony also hand free built bose sony cheaper although give premium feel get bose the sony pretty nicely built look elegant minimalistic compared bose feel expensive especially thin bottom plastic base give pretty cheap impression i also noticed body sony could squeezed little bit resulted slight crackling sometimes also noticable playing deep bass note could hear body resonate i never bose massive unibody aluminium housing while bose distort bassheavy mix already half volume would hear bass starting fart little bit sony distortion problem track bose seems push bass far possible sometimes might result much especially level become serious noticable lower higher volume instead sony hear crosstalk bass treble result judder noticeable hi hat cymbal the bose would also obvious sound muffled sony clear treble really hear well lower frequency influence treble with loud piano sound guitar bose always sound clear never distort i noticed crackling rasping track sony seems distortion problem mid frequency although dial back bass quite much higher volume bose still try keep whole spectrum level sony start sounding different upper bass disappearing completely treble becoming even biting i also noticed quite bit dynamic compression sony regardless actual volume set especially get volume bluetooth device set maximum i found sony sound better volume iphone lowered notch increased speaker instead i would preferred single synchronized volume control speaker streaming device many company manage sony bose because especially speaker notice big difference sound depending much cranked speaker low volume set player mostly result dynamic equalizing try compensate natural loudness effect human hearing but algorithm seem rely real actual output level rather seem also influenced absolute level speaker set input level streaming device these many variable make loudness compensation work properly which i like i sure on track i still like bose it sound fuller dynamic others i prefer sony sound pleasant listen dull recorded track sound considerably better sony bright bass light recording alread sound overly bright tend sound better bose both perfect rather meant lower volume sony sound good even lowest possible step bose usually sound boomy muffled certain volume reached for outside listening i still like bose i side side placed equally switched whole time whole day made wife crazy in i definitely preferred bose i thought sony sound better for outdoor sony critical positioning indoors way round depends priority it depends taste well i pretty sure prefer sony seems eq tuned typical bathtub curve bose seems pay attention good defined mids well it treble bose seems bit shy speaker sure the weakest point sony seems battery though seem replaceable seem powerful bose for part i probably keep in comment i linked direct comparison speaker both carefully recorded condition zoom h recorder i hope give idea differ sound relatively one of course please listen good headphone choose highest stream quality really notice subtle detail amazing speaker even though le wattage srsx i side side comparable except loud volume the difference two minimal low volume i compared sony product comparable bose product ended going sony even though i owned many bose speaker past you find hard believe sound come sx if plan lot loud volume play back however may want try sx just beware charger plug issue sx quite large reason look around sale sx often price sx fills fairly large room sound light dancing as many inexpensive speaker bass somewhat boomy serious music listening main speaker sound much better also course one speaker cannot get stereo separation attached photo show used dance class local yoga studio i got speaker birthday work well it loud good bass it also good size the battery last pretty long i wish would last longer this speaker excellent i read review i purchased said battery run time le six hour advertise i found speaker last six hour i listen rock music i tend blast speaker full volume i half volume last little five hour normal playing anyway lasted six hour minute the clip attache belt loop anywhere like making easy carry around phone conversation clear easy answer phone speaker using headphone jack back speaker wire directly device save battery life using bluetooth feature i highly recommend speaker pros bluetooth connectivity easy use can answer call speaker mic phone close previous jbl speaker required using phone talk mic excellent clarity speaker even higher volume the built clip make convenient carry cons the button difficult feel want look speaker find button driving troublesome control speaker the volume control directly opposite power button get used tendency turn device when hard wire speaker phone instead using bluetooth mic portion work i posted picture left headphone jack jbl speaker three contact one right headphone mic four contact fourth contact mic i love speaker much i actually bought another one back i recommend even bought one gift this second jbl clip bought year ago month first one got lost that i immediately bought replacement sign quality i truly say changed bicycle life i rarely leave house without as pic show endured rough handling many drop bump rain extreme nyc heat yet still play run well i would however given possible due relative

speaker onto shower caddy if i shower caddy clip i would clipped onto shower curtain clip perfectly fine option the speaker stayed place fine clip when time i connected phone speaker via bluetooth

get thinner the top speaker touch sensor button built light make convenient use le light area in back micro sd card slot make convenient case i need phone use something else yet still able listen music micro sd card the speaker finished high gloss paint make look nice stylish its battery life last around hour playing i enjoy lot course compare expensive brand name speaker price range work great i like take beach park add festivity spirit fun family friend i bought fury bluetooth speaker discounted price product testing purpose honest unbiased opinion experience speaker waited year saying anything make sure speaker wire worth paying turned attic bedroom one big beautiful speaker box wire holding perfectly hard screw i purchased speaker wire install new surround sound this much sturdy wire surround sound came my downfall i underestimated length i needed accounting extra two speaker no big deal i order second reel i plan using wire banana plug easily plug back unit it good solid wire used throughout entire system everything wire good not mind blowingly amazing good i used several time wall nearly year just recently i rewiring i relocating home theater wiring the wiring exposed rear terminal oxidized dis colorized changed resistance since initial purchase only reason i docked star insulation around lead wire outer insulation thick robust feeling mediabridge similarly priced competitor it good speaker cable i recommend just anything silly like put outside better cable job i attached picture seen outside wall the rest hidden great easy install fan move adequate amount air no adapter needed equipment usb port also really nice fan controller built also able daisy chain fan i process remodeling basement i thought add built speacker system i quite bit research picked speaker wall connector i review later installed as wire i knew i get rated wall use i found guage work well mid length run given power draw i system set yet i comment sound wire i know i would enough audiophile tell difference anyway not unless significantly underrated installation being braided wire thick smooth sleeve rather easy pull i spent time rethinking home theater setup i running cable the end eay terminate banana plug i ordered job went well the downside i ordered short i needed i odered another that though givving measurement enough wiggle room my audio sound great length needed living room bed apt arrived expected good price opinion little speaker rock i many bluetooth speaker including bose soundlink mini biggest deference two bass yeah i seen review youtube bashing lack bass bass mini overpowering seems appropriate particular genre speaker sound great work broad spectrum level size perfect tabletop mini may better filling larger area speaker perfect room smaller living space doorm paring breeze compared others i another advantage i like many others besides annoying blinking paired light auto function feature disabled preferred problem i experiencing choosing black white bought accident amazon app thank one click purchase dang i glad i excellent loud bose quality super light rugged design pretty great battery life you amazed much bass volume thing put easily fill large living room sound battery life last day half average music playing one hr loud session much phone would need charging really great throwing bag outing pool beach still sound pretty great outdoors really happy i spent much seeing last looooong time knowing bose only complaint connecting bluetooth phone randomly pain though instantaneous half time maybe ios thing really non issue ps get forget double tap play skip next track i purchased speaker three month ago initial intention using play music kitchen cooking since become go speaker choice throughout house first ease use no complicated set instead counting beep blink bose talk i enable bluetooth device i wish pair push bluetooth pairing button bose confirms successful pairing speaks name device connected your device name here in addition i control volume setting device pause play button atop bose soundlink i love product manufacturer understands wisdom keep it simple stupid as i said i initially purchased play music kitchen whoosh generated exhaust hood stove dominant overpowers ceiling mounted hard wired bose speaker adjacent great room the full rich sound produced bose soundlink speaker job it easily beat back stove hood without crank volume window shaking level of course i lying i said bose soundlink better four ceiling mounted hard wired bose speaker great room even champion middleweight match four heavyweight however bose soundlink hold one one room bedroom bathroom laundry room etc also easy use effortlessly portable hardly use hard wired speaker nowadays aforementioned room the bose soundlink battery hold least six hour charge however battery energy expended production sound fair assume duration single charge vary greatly depending upon volume level simply put play soundlink several hour non stop full volume surely exhaust fully charged battery sooner played non stop lower volume there however downside possible rank half star i deduced one half star rating the con i discovered use soundlink rechargeable battery neither removable replaceable eventually die that small concern it fair assume speaker still play via included power cord battery reach end rechargeable lifespan however severely diminish ease portability help make soundlink great product to fair day still long way according bose battery still provide percent capacity th recharge based family current usage soundlink long time however looking something use every day six hour day might want go another product i think bose mini version soundlink feature replaceable battery i used product i offer informed comment regard all i like thing i two bose bluetooth speaker this one smallest favorite great battery life small size great sound mean speaker travel nearly everywhere i use stream podcasts car home music boat beach even taking shower the sound clear crisp even high volume road noise car never problem the white noise shower ocean drown unfortunately car come equipped auxiliary port bluetooth capability but speaker resolved problem much lower expense either installed plus i also use outside vehicle versatility huge plus the thing i wish microphone completing call i purchase item amazon this item received promotional item credit union i received no discount credit compensation exchange review not enough star galaxy little gem bose get better i fan bose year first car stereo i installed bose system you get better quality product the clarity amazing bose right one time i play day still battery life bonus take customize color go decor is anything bose right love love love little speaker wow i so many speaker either big crappy sound these are fricking great i tried store immediately bought using last day i really want shake hand engineer product development guy bose finally making perfect size speaker it small enough fit laptop back light i sometimes check i forget when bose soundlink mini started going fritz i went spree buying replacement this review compare i ended note i not get free exchange review wish i knew many people seem day i probably write review seeing almost every day christmas thanks amazon ask ups fedex guy know dog name lol the speaker bose soundlink color bose soundlink mini bose soundtouch inateck marsbox bp bluetooth speaker alpatronix ax rugged splashproof bluetooth speaker the color overall best four portable imho i use main comparator color v mini i think color overall better sound mini general purpose especially relatively loud volume though reading review i know others disagree i play classical music classic rock see the sound two different flip back forth within one song ipod touch allows pair the difference sound rather like difference shape speaker almost the mini like larger bose speaker it deep rich sound lower range expense including upper range fully sound kind flat sometimes compared color go back forth the color well colorful sound term full spectrum sound equally it quite depth lower range though overcome setting sound equalizer setting appropriately discussed later i guess depends kind music mostly listen like boston john denver fleetwood mac sound better mini rush journey ac dc better color though acceptable either especially compared speaker yes i product i listen kind music it noticeable away i often sit right next speaker case noticeable medium volume what noticeable switch next color much much louder volume setting i testing sound quality across room foot maximum volume point quality difference sometimes striking the color reliable mini ever it work well two three ipods touch touch nano mini pair nano it tell literally speaks battery getting low run well charger though i try potentially ruin battery the mini sometimes die even plugged inexplicable reason kind like overheats something come back minute awhile the mini work even plugged battery totally dead the mini stopped working base charge plugged directly not big deal strange i never sure purpose base anyway the color lighter portable withstood several drop foot ground i know sure long battery last i really paying close attention working night i estimate hour depending loud play music v mini though i may wrecked battery life mini leaving plugged much time sure one need regularly fully charged discharged maintain life suspect color mini v bose soundtouch got soundtouch i tired little speaker running battery working night i wanted something louder little speaker well soundtouch run battery plug definitely louder used ipod touches with nano loudest one non bose speaker yet discussed soundtouch least produce sound hear adequately sitting within foot nano it kind sound expect larger bose speaker blowing back black album water high volume ipod touch it connect sort thing one inclined use way i live middle nowhere dsl worse dial anticipate using function it remember ipod connected last find easily whatever else turned one available however remember go bluetooth first instead looking wireless network i always push button get go kind annoying when playing side side mini color color performed admirably thing like fleetwood mac le bass compared somewhat similar volume max color half max soundtouch comparison something like back black the mini achieve adequate volume compare bass advantage color disappeared compared worst three these comparison foot across room direction due location soundtouch close putting next foot behind much difference two term i prefer even ac dc lower volume actually the advantage soundtouch circumstance run battery but ac dc meant cranked soundtouch truly great for portable speaker color hold regard the mini job bose color v inateck marsbox the marsbox decent little speaker it hardly fair compare anything bose it full sound color much power used ipod touch full volume i went back forth two playing the devil went down georgia touch since connect two device example the bose much louder overall bit fuller fiddle music interestingly ipod nano color pair fine even nano turned max volume i could hear unless i put ear barely on marsbox i could hear fine across room foot away noisy pellet stove blowing background with ipod touch twice loud nano max volume marsbox power device obviously make difference type speaker the marsbox also used speaker phone whereas far i tell color cannot it paired year old flip phone worked make answer call the person end said muffled difficult hear however cell service poor sure speaker poor reception old phone end in case advertised even year old flip phone area poor cell service may work better modern smart phone area better cell coverage lol the radio function work though control bit mystery i lost direction would find bible reading station the radio reception like cell phone internet everything else rather sketchy i live wood middle nowhere however seeking others would come would blow i find way stop see enough reception work i probably leave speaker work play boat drinks jimmy buffet i shot hole freezer i think i got cabin fever patient complaining well right seem forget every year february wisconsin northwoods dreary time it work well purpose alpatronix ax v inateck marsbox briefly compare little pocket speaker bose alpatronix ax little speaker meant shower carrying around different it loud marsbox good sound type speaker better marsbox certain type music play well nano you clip belt waistband stick shirt pocket man shirt decent pocket probably tie wrist strap something only downer place attach carabiner i found way around i removed wrist strap stuck piece pipe cleaner make loop attach clip put piece rope tie around neck definitely worth small amount money i paid relatively loud stereo speaker i wear around i thing outside property i feel like wearing headphone get tangled thing i carrying like tree branch example running around three flight stair carrying thing reorganizing house to make best sound speaker take little fiddling trial error equalizer setting ipod whatever device playing i found artist like bob seger billy joel arlo guthrie etc lounge setting noticeably better rest for others treble reducer setting better others even bass booster small speakers much fuller sound late night sometimes produce interesting effect the specific one like rock latin whatever generally sound good waste time easy enough check in case check made huge difference i discovered music setting ipod well enough still reading i tried put product link make work sorry if review helpful please click yes if please click it help know i decide whether spend time writing review any comment question welcome well thanks good luck finding need i ordered another even littler speaker will update useful addendum new little waav rocker best wearing around last hour see pic

speaker acoustic tuning nob speaker grille price accessories included mm cable mm rca cable rca mm adapter speaker wire subwoofer port mm design power management the speaker sleep inactivity wake needed cons no remote volume control unless controlled via bluetooth source volume control other thoughts tl dr the presonus ceres c bt speaker good option good price point they input accommodate many different need produce good sound via wire wireless bluetooth input i highly recommend speaker anyone looking delve higher audio quality without breaking bank after recently acquiring record player great built speaker i found looking better audio active bookshelf speaker one requirement finding option available subwoofer i subwoofer lying around old pioneer avr setup without use before beginning search active speaker i never heard presonus product i understand used exclusively creative professional decided bring option home market i ended landing ceres series presonus comparing several competing option audioengine kanto m audio psb others quite meet criterion the ceres series ended cheapest featured filled option price i surprised see ceres speaker feature competitor lower price point so reading watching review online pointed positive experience i picked pair i took speaker box plugged hooking anything else perform basic audio test worked the first feature i tested bluetooth streaming i received black sabbath album paranoid free google play music decided use test album i connected phone speaker via bluetooth dead simple might i add prepared stream audio wow i surprised great sounded they produced good audio detail high low coming clearly bluetooth streaming i surprised relatively small speaker could produce clear sound i hooked subwoofer give little bit extra sound low end fell love even smaller driver produce fantastic sound coupled subwoofer extra sound low end i really able enjoy music i hooked record player listened record surprised well sounded the difference sound quality via bluetooth via wire indistinguishable least huge plus i pleased speaker purchase decision the brand presonus may widely known consumer definitely produce good product good price point i sure option good pay feature set audio quality presonus speaker provided would silly opinion if looking dive higher quality audio experience i highly recommend solid option break bank while i classify videophile passing interest audio i early adopt multi channel surround sound year ago i fell favor early opting recently quality stereo setup multi channel a v receiver

two decent its i would call surperb looking entry level bluetooth speaker there sense comparing speaker time expensive since thats apple orange it good sound break crackle even turned maximum volume there bass skiva due size necessarily sound full again thats necessarily strike speaker price range comparable sound quality sound volume skiva win big time this come pure watt watt really push sound i would say alpatronix would good personal speaker gathering people the skiva would good party people still able heard appearance this personal preference thing i prefer sleek design alpatronix skiva the appearance skiva something would keep buying though i like black pattern become busy so end would i buy skiva audioflow if i needed speaker perform larger gathering i think obvious choice all

started sounding like kitchen radio played beolit i also binaural recording post video listening session soon the beolit look like old one gone buggy airplay connection beolit come bluetooth also apt x supported best quality soundwise beolit big improvement old one the bass punch especially mid bass aggressive probably thanks passive radiator side important sound nearly non directional especially treble response suffered quite lot old one listened exactly front the new one tweeter front edge one backside give quite true sound pretty close sound pretty good even completely behind manages fill large area sound much better treble harsh a clearer beolit the beolit quite bit louder though i would say sound sound good close maximum beolit sound still top volume hardly bass loss distortion it quite bit louder infinity one bose soundlink iii example beolit sound much powerful manages keep bass high level well i thought mids slightly recessed overall sound pretty good nevertheless one best i heard portable speaker t a klipsch kmc definitely powerful louder sound good normal listening level miss refinement beolit also keep mind kmc larger need extra battery portable use of course i test

software enhance utility performance before reviewing beolit i like take minute describe i trying accomplish i concluded beolit provided best solution as audiophile i enjoy sitting inside listening music purest form i wanted able enjoy indoor listening experience outside deck after auditioning several outdoor speaker i unimpressed impossible justify expense running wire mount mediocre outdoor speaker sound system house i considered bringing inside speaker outside needed ruled option much inconvenience initially i auditioned single beolit side side beoplay a both produce amazing sound small form factor beolit greater dynamic range lower bass response a the beolit also creates superior degree illusion a sold single beolit i auditioned two beolit paired together the stereophonic experience sound stage created pairing together rival surpass almost indoor system preamp amplifier truly amazing i attached photo speaker placement i settled experimentation as see speaker placed foot apart slightly angled inwards towards couch front fireplace this speaker placement creates sweet spot center couch speaker virtually disappear the voice seem emanate inside fireplace remaining sound surround listener rich clear sound there something going inside beolit separate sound way music i heard hundred time sound new you hear nuance like breath saxophone player note close eye perceive background singer standing recording made they amazing paired together if buy two use paired experiment speaker placement passing judgement when placed close together may sound muddy distorted but find sweet spot amazed at half volume speaker loud enough disturb neighbor unfortunately half volume i able get half hour playing time plugging outlet this unacceptable especially b o advertises hour battery life perhaps pairing draining power i experiment one update review later date another disappointment lack apple airplay sometimes party flow inside nice stream music inside airplay make easy if aux port worked pairing could work around airport express airplay enabled router i mentioned aux port work single unit the a work airplay b o could made beolit work well as side note beolit mini usb port inside power cord compartment back updating firmware i already updated firmware i hopeful perhaps fix issue future update if i amend review accordingly overall i happy pair beolit but poor battery life inability play paired aux port lack airplay streaming loses least one star but honestly little nit pick enough trade another option cover issue cost sound quality i believe better portable bluetooth speaker market bang olufsen beolit pros amazing balanced sound when paired another beolit two create sound stage rival exceed many expensive component system cons battery life fraction advertised at half volume i able get hour play paired another beolit when paired another beolit aux input work must stream via bluetooth paired this design flaw fixed no apple airplay option

expect atv i mine mounted honda rancher took literally minute install i however recommend following instruction installing line power switch intend mounting something without power socket overall i completely satisfied look hold well application i always wanted loud speaker system atv i finally pulled plug planet audio patv speaker system led light bar the unit came packaged well plenty accessory mounting option it come strap secure type riding i sometimes i use ratchet style strap extra level security oem one sit shelf the unit plug right cigarette style plug atv side side hard wire right battery supplied plug adapter i this way i hide wiring know i direct battery connection best power connection voltage current supply pairing iphone fast simple i enjoy listening everything country rock electronic pop i also bit audiophile i know good music sound like the frequency response said hz khz i would estimate low end sound like reach hz top end nice clear without bright this thing loud i happy see use class a b amplifier really best world instead mono class amplifier especially something mobile with volume maxed unit phone loud would problem riding gravel road hearing music even helmet my gripe slight one bass response would expect driver it good mid bass punch look case scream bass ok front having said important recognize subwoofer system would need dedicated amp run woofer would kill atv battery short order let alone work alternator machine running i parked wheeler cutting tree clearing brush afternoon at one point i foot wheeler i could hear every song playing play list although i enjoy serenity wood i working bring motivation the led light bar another big plus system if never experienced light bar never go back one this led bar double light output

hope found review helpful please click yes button thanks this great outdoor speaker waterproof built tough rugged looking i wish i atv fine suv camping park i plugged external jump starter light came bright useful syncing speaker iphone super easy sound wise i expected better price point granted outdoor speaker shape casing scream bass much oomph i expected the high mids better side thing i able blast crowded outdoor simple test perfectly well outdoor use overall great outdoor speaker i wish sound bit warmer coming unfortunately sound tinny i suppose small discreet speaker adequate enhancing television sound definitely room filling speaker i torn whether i keep i griffin power mate unfortunately basically mac product connected mac work beautifully multi functional although i use volume control muting software allows wide range functionality there windows software technically work windows griffin stopped updating around windows vista as result windows installs software flaky the biggest problem boot reliably windows this required lot unplugging replugging starting windows i tried running compatibility mode adjusting start time using delay thing no luck it beautiful piece hardware though the look feel exceed price point once started work well volume controller muting device windows among thing i wish griffin would finally throw windows user bone update software which brings controller the good it work right box no software needed the cable long enough allow many placement option the cable nice cloth wrap most importantly interfere audio path it connected usb port even hub it volume controller muting device independant audio path simple premise work advertised the bad budget feel say least hollow plasticky far light it stay put it even anti slip coating bottom something i add the top drag place bottom unit spin controller a hollow plastic dragging sound the top loose light pressure feel wobbly when i opened three screw bottom plate underneath felt like coating i could see controller mounted slight angle the part controller exit top device controller press fit cause controller spinning unevenly an easily prevented quality control issue there provision adjusting speed volume control it slow requires turning i like make adjustment making adjustment awkward the top controller wide thin gripping make adjustment little awkward one finger adjustment difficult the finish high gloss finger print dust magnet first order if willing make couple mod however issue easily addressed using broken wind chime i replaced top piece wooden wind chime wind catcher you use anything using dashboard anti slip pad i cut size piece new knob wind catcher make one finger adjustment possible i bottom device slip desk top i reluctant remove remount controller concern i break this mean i still slight wobble new knob smaller mounted little higher least drag lower piece at first i thought price good compared griffin powermate immediately apparent griffin expensive the griffin high quality piece hardware backed good software mac good software windows regardless i think supplier right track i think market inexpensive volume muting controller pc if address quality control design issue would five star product sure i especially like require software software support aside griffin device league ahead design quality control logitech nulooq also nice device like griffin discontinued software support windows the downside griffin nulooq require software considering griffin powermate found low dollar wired version choosing griffin brainer using mac the griffin much nicer hardware design multi functional for windows user willing make couple simple mod i prefer drok volume control muting this bluetooth speaker awesome it came opportune time want say good time cuz i bad cold week i either sitting outside knitting listening amazon prime music speaker sitting inside thing it paired samsung smartphone really easy all i need press button

developed i recall noticing i first reviewed bluetooth digital transmission technique noise generated within sony amplifier real excuse however still travel speaker choice despite newly discovered

performance price point i owned reviewed a lot bluetooth speaker high end b o a mid tier lower priced model fenix when reviewing i take price account for le twenty buck best model i tested features what i like best speaker includes micro sd card slot marked tf slot speaker play mp natively without device necessary this turn fenix simple portable mp jukebox i also like simple three way toggle switch power bluetooth play aforementioned mp player another simple multifunction slider control advancing skipping track well play pause sound quality going blow away adequate use small space treble tinny bass response weak i hold speaker price range the sound volume pretty decent bluetooth connection easy set the instruction said i would need enter pair device nexus paired without code design aesthetic reasonably good the speaker look nice inside drum speaker angle using inside drum shape redirect sound i audio engineer i suspect fenix produce much volume size my real complaint speaker excessively bright blue led blink incessantly bluetooth mode i attached image led distracting especially dimly lighted room this pretty substantial design flaw why make bright why blink thing hence reduction star star overall great speaker price absent annoying blinking led i give five star might consider buying electrical tape covering stupid led disclaimer i received speaker manufacturer purpose providing review i received form compensation outside speaker i replacing amazing little sony srs x something i hoping big upgrade i initially purchased sony srs x something missing high price tag i returned internet research i set mind ue megaboom while megaboom design feature fantastic disappointing bass i decided stop best buy quick survey whats available whats display my visit extended minute hour best buy probably portable wireless speaker connected music source one could test out model one shine rest jbl extreme best buy agree price match i decided go home buy amazon at home i continued researching i came across oontz angle xl ultra one reviewer claimed listen side side jbl wrote friend picked jbl loudness bass i looking loudness though cant hurt i looking rich full sound i decided order jbl oontz today i listening sony ue jbl oontz side side conclusion sony srs x little sony still amazing sound small sound oontz angle xl ultra louder sony high clear jbl ue low better ue come nearly close jbl thank dishonest reviewer agenda glorify undeserving speaker probably personal profit ue megaboom high mids speaker fantastic better jbl small margin the design waterproof built size battery charge via micro usb far superior jbl sound missing low big time placing speaker corner help still pronounced base more like ghost bass jbl extreme twice heavy large inferior tech comparison ue speaker choice the sound rich full much superior rest i tested it worth noting get real loud still sound fantastic there feature i mention like internal battery life spec make difference

amazed good store little audio system sounded it turn running megabooms ue boom corner store the store packed usual music loud crystal clear complete bottom end thump this got thinking get those martini party prior i looking studio monitor w sub package expensive option obviously i went ue megabooms four update well martini night i brought four guy get togethers performed awesomely seriously

battery life i got home the guest amazed great sound coming speaker granted paid gig i never client point sounded awesome we another martini party next week better believe quadruplet full effect why did i get the megabooms i really wanted easy setup something truly wireless something sounded decent take little space and i saved like i detail experience note i refer megabooms uemb easy setup you really cannot get easier setup uemb as dj i deal cable wire every week it get tiring as uembs bluetooth need device going stream pair the pairing process easy bluetooth speaker simply turn speaker bt signal blink go device bt settings choose ue megaboom that now since i wanted advance feature along daisy chaining one unit i downloaded uemb app the app easy use handhold connecting speaker device well walk updating speaker firmware i highly suggest right away note i upadated firmware mine within minute total time if you are going to stream to more than one speaker simultaneously will need download uemb app once app change name speaker i named mine megaboom change eq settings etc if you want to daisy chain play music on multiple speakers at the same time main screen ue app simply swipe screen right left walk get device connected feature called partyup i done daily since getting speaker work flawlessly really issue whatsoever if daisy chain speaker probably want change standard name this help looking partyup screen positioning speaker see image having named different assist cutting party needed name show press hold tiny image speaker now many mentioned every i do get clipping choppy audio i narrowed thing nagging techie background kicking if device running multiple apps cause aforementioned audio issue also reason many device uembs range bluetooth enabled cause intermitant issue i went around house turning bluetooth everything testing purpose i still tracking issue getting closer getting seemless audio experience prior january party truly wireless the heading say there really no wire needed decent audio session of course battery driven device power brick usb cable the uembs come bright lime cable power brick i guess make look unique you definately need recharge speaker time time how often though well i mine running hour interval gotten battery this normal volume i intend listen much louder i big gun i thinking going short clip percentage i could probably play hour get not bad speaker size so connected power run time need charge every day unless play like hour day in regard charging the most idiotic usb charging port location known man yeah i know strong word seriously the charging port bottom unit so wanted charge play time either lie side cutting lot famed degree field audio or turn upside silly looking super thick usb cable protruding top i get why put port back gigatic volume button sound quality here i think speaker shine can get better sounding speaker elsewhere sure can get better sounding speaker elsewhere price now maybe can get better sounding waterproof speaker price point probably as audio professional i enjoy good sounding speaker shoot lot revenue stream depends i say speaker sound really good especially small size the high mids stand driver however considering size physical internal speaker bass response very good well not earth shattering sub bass good good size comparabely priced speaker the high mids sound really clear reproduced well i played lot mix tape well mix mp listening small home studio high mid range sound reproduced well the brochure claim bass response uembs around htz i thinking that deep

since getting speaker sonos support inability provide useful support resolve issue i still like speaker work randomly disappear app annoying bring back fortunately issue typically occurs every several week i tend play four speaker one large group apparent reason speaker stop playing evening connected directly ethernet cable upon inspection i find speaker removed app i tried number way try resolve sonos support totally useless actually frustrating deal i sure knowledgeable support staff pretty apparent use house script response experience totally use they ask thing make sense like checking wifi speaker hardwired directly ethernet cable anyway back particular issue the way i found resolve issue add least one device back that bring speaker back still allow playing music the next thing i turn group go single speaker play once i single speaker playing i restart group play function i explained sonos support nothing suggest nonsense close ticket update i pleased sonos finally updated software support audible i prefer listening book learning something new i activity rather background distraction these speaker keep getting better better now sonos could figure address speaker losing wireless connectivity disappearing sonos menu i still find standard troubleshooting tool fixing issue useful definitely router issue sonos support scripted answer i many iot device connected home network none encounter issue the way i found resolve unplug electrical cord device attach unplugging cord outlet never worked unplugging cord device always corrected connectivity issue oddly enough i raised issue sonos support unable provide plausible solution yet update there lot positive say speaker however limitation i would say audiophile quality that withstanding little speaker excellent sound quality extremely attractive the sound best i experienced far come wireless speaker many wired speaker however thing changing fast new competition coming including apple google new echo plus others i know might compare there also new sonos one integrated far field voice alexa but ala still analog hdmi input interface input sound source a key reason i went play anticipated integration alexa finally yay the initial functionality bit limited really good start opinion trying get audible play sonos speaker real pain i waiting sonos add audible back supported service line i done lot far sonos play alexa integration i used thus far great enhancement serf many need exception audible integration this assumes alexa integration device want alexa play music sonos speaker one thing i mention even though sonos issue i alexa dot placed next one sonos play speaker often sonos playing dot respond i able correct part moving dot speaker this seems address thing fairly well if using google home ecosystem sorry still compatible i sure sonos plan eventual compatibility google ecosystem i personally believe integration would great enhancement great selling point sonos thing google yet possible alexa e g playing youtube content it easy get started first need add enable sonos skill alexa app run dicovery you may need rename speaker happen named based room located name match something already name alexa the alexa voice service skill included far seem limited playing pausing stopping speaker adjusting volume asking alexa playing alexa play music sonos speaker grouping speaker group smart device my favorite far beyond basic grouping multiple sonos speaker together this really nice touch i personally love speaker grouping function use time there probably function one i used thus far i sure sonos continue add new capability i hope support google home siri included future despite fact heart currently belongs alexa now sonos play speaker already i would suggest first evaluate new sonos one speaker far field voice integration i still disappointed new speaker add input interface analog input device i still puzzled sonos exploit ethernet input device while maybe ideal many would improvement something i tried yet since i one may possible stream amazon fire device sonos speaker if anyone figure please let know my issue minor part the annoying problem i loss wireless connectivity i never found standard troubleshooting tool fixing issue useful the way i found resolve unplug electrical cord device attach unplugging cord outlet never worked unplugging cord device always corrected connectivity issue oddly enough i raised issue sonos support unable provide plausible solution yet i would like mention experience seller i used despite fact i review sorry world wide

class pc speaker far better cheap plastic piece crap class speaker short full audiophile system utilizing passive speaker separate amp dac etc for near field usage i use sitting desk type system would far overkill even guy like overkill probably others short studio mastering system the a edge built dac depending noisy crappy pc dac may major selling point given similar cost i prefer dac built even using probably crappy dell laptop dac e luna rich full sound good imaging placed either side samsung cf monitor the bass much fuller i expected well certainly expect bass like dedicated performance subwoofer good sound bloated ear i may play around external usb dac future i content as far design i fan audio engine a minimalist purposeful design however basically box the e luna quite striking unusual far design may love hate thing i like both great finish i would prefer normal speaker post connection instead proprietary connection e luna using work fine cable plenty long system please note picture i initially hooked backwards corrected the right channel speaker house power audio input connection along proprietary connection go left channel speaker i got today quickly unboxed sound look

turn volume ten speaker limit output certain frequency beyond speaker capability this give distortion free sound level it also extends life speaker one thing i caution fake there least one company making charge fake china while real version made china also much better quality the fake hard distinguish first glance definitely tell difference sound quality be sure purchasing reputable vendor even amazon while i bought mine amazon still supplied brick mortar stereo store authorized jbl dealer beware ebay i bought one refurbished unit e warehouse deals seller pleased purchase the speaker came

option day bt speaker extensive searching testing i feel jbl truly one best brand especially price overall i pleased speaker highly recommend if you have a macbook might notice sound choppy go skip to

roommate i really needed put fullest volume yet it either lay side little soft silicon stand bottom one side stand upright i highly highly recommend speaker great quality great price ive several device year play music before i logitech device i could plug ipod nano bluetooth still got job done my dad several bluetooth speaker year he giant one used provide entertainment graduation party back bonfire it good quality big really practical then small one shark listening music front porch end day dragged stereo receiver real speaker subwoofer left winter quality low shark worth ease however changed got speaker quality a month ago dad bought new bluetooth speaker jbl charge it still winter bought listen music practically every night we use onkyo home theater subwoofer everything inside never loud basically background music u talk the first day played many night i able tell whether he playing expensive home theater little device i think thats huge testament amazing speaker now turn full volume would entirely different story the home theater crank never anything blaring really thats use speaker work perfectly purpose as well i think pretty tailored taste right bat number equalizer apps market able get level bass treble exactly like i iphone apple music app equalizer my dad however android phone different app us all thing said done size i cant believe amazing bass connectivity controls ive paired device ipad i wanted test long take pair new device i tried iphone to pair device first need turn jbl hitting power button way left then hit bluetooth logo button directly right power button then phone quickly popped bluetooth screen setting jbl charge found then click voila connected the whole process took second there six button jbl from left right power button bluetooth pairing button volume down volume up party mode telephone button a cool feature also displayed top jbl set light volume these light much battery life left speaker i particularly like light system i think number informative number i think many device use three instead another thing i wanted test party mode i saw review amazon say could connect one device time this took little bit messing around iphone dad samsung s americans need manual say also know manual find answer say in end fairly easy figure once bluetooth paired device wanted pair jbl least hit party mode button th one look vaguely like three people hanging from multiple device could select jbl connect to pair one device youve got party mode first the party mode kind really cool i know well would work depending group friend i say whoever selects song first song played then second party look device choose song however second party pick song hit play override first person play second person song it pause first person song override happened middle song first person hit play would override second person therefore i think super effective two three mature adult could actually pick song order without jumping nobody my family mature i imagine using much i wanted test prove work nonetheless the final button telephone button this way i use jbl talk someone called i never use either talking loudly speaker style and nobody call know i hate talking phone first place distance i always test device distance leaving jbl porch dad i walked away see many pace i could go started breaking of device ive tested far one farthest distance well foot in fact i start crossing street started breaking something closer foot inside nowhere i go would break i could leave device downstairs carry jbl upstairs still

speaker always sound great light red warn low battery charge ive never fan multi light gadget i like speaker much wow start review little machine score big fat ten every category it good looking well built woman would getting wolf whistle time it really heavy i plan use i hiking biking of course i stopped listening i case heck i slap puppy backpack go nice strap detachable make easy carry kinda like full lunchbox i set baby ipad rd gen also imac this rare occasion i nice external speaker already watching movie kinda need wide separate stereo first plugged charge once plugged play charging synced ipad playing music le minute this baby loud i never turned way it also solid movement vibration this purchase one best i ever made whole lotta bang buck jimi hendrix would love little box listen music well i gotsa go rock on whether like speaker mainly depend using for us speaker darn near perfect i mail carrier spends roughly hour day mail truck i using good portable speaker called iloud ik multimedia it big name like bose jbl fly radar if looking smaller lighter speaker best class sound quality imo one thing i like believe weight it kept tipping taking sharp corner running bump the kilburn solid rock respect rarely move even ice the pound make perfect travel use likely tip solid flat surface ik iloud vs marshall kilburn the iloud previously owned speaker some people would say fair compare pound speaker pound speaker retail so keep mind although iloud sound amazingly good size compete clean near distortion free sound kilburn but expected kilburn weighs twice much twice deep iloud the treble iloud good arguably better respect kilburn time though get blaring distorted louder volume bass considerably better kilburn however high pretty even iloud seems slightly better mid range but listen rock anything us bass worth tradeoff imo slightly weaker midrange the real disadvantage kilburn one woofer v two iloud however kilburn us woofer iloud us two woofers the downside speaker sound little mono one woofer two tweeters help simulate stereo well enough the upside get deeper cleaner bass le distortion since really hear much stereo separation much anyway single speaker i think good tradeoff despite heavier i find kilburn easier carry around handle the iloud handle us somewhat flimsy kick stand help keep speaker tipping it however angled upward slightly aim music ear better desk mail vehicle however easily create little wooden stand like i fix issue bluetooth i biggest fan bluetooth for one sound compressed never match direct connection another reliable matter good device connection easily interfered nearby device using similar frequency it nice though time want listen music pinch want easy hookup on bluetooth music sounded bit dark missing sparkle opinion though i heard lot people complaining poor bluetooth reception i able go outside still maintain connection wall near ft away so time i used worked well interruption aux input if really want hear speaker capable though must run neutral amp usb dac hook amp color sound also dac color sound actually hear speaker designed sound like bass mids highs sound marvelous another bonus depending amp dac hooking able push speaker limit beyond limited volume get using phones amp example the problem phone amp pretty much change sound overemphasize bass treble they mainly designed push small earbuds poor sound quality need boost get decent sound this bad thing hooking bigger speaker need boost the difference using usb dac phone vs bluetooth night day the bass much cleaner treble far clear do favor pick objective usb dac amp want premium sound go it bit hassle setup worth especially long stay hotel something this speaker honestly almost rival main bookshelf speaker aspect sound quality especially bass department get deeper sounds pretty good without subwoofer small room you feel bass penetrate body loud volume of course always sound better sub particularity larger room the midrange highs still bit better bookshelf pretty darn good portable oh knobs there excuse every speaker bass treble knob song much treble bass simple quick adjustment battery life best battery i seen portable speaker yet at least wired connection i still ran low battery played hour beyond max volume i generally need hour time us excellent i sure bluetooth last quite long i personally use often negatives now couple minor annoyance i dock star another reviewer correctly pointed slight volume fluctuation speaker loud volume certain song however really noticeable unless ear right speaker loud volume from distance hear not nearly bad enough deal breaker this still disappointing happen speaker good almost every respect one issue ipods phones generally enough power drive speaker properly you need almost max volume get near speaker potential get distortion maxing phone amp also speaker sound somewhat mono single although great woofer i willing deal slight issue perfect speaker almost every way i prefer direct usb audio anyway if speaker last i quite happy we see bottom line you love speaker listen classic rock easy listening hip hop type music looking good hallway speaker you probably care looking bluetooth speaker light weather proof serious sound update september th maybe speaker broken i first used may bad equalizer setting causing clipping i hearing volume fluctuate like i thought may happening i first got i still amazed well box pump sound well battery held durable i actually foolishly dropped foot onto tar road hauling work vehicle albeit well protected case absolutely damage sound better ever since the thing i could possibly knock speaker able hear static fuzz loud volume tolerable uncommon many speaker you hear anyway unless listening completely silent room sound quality superb rock song especially with newer portable device i found necessary add extra hardware mm cable connect smartphone the photive cyren small yet powerful portable bluetooth speaker provides crisp clear sound rival expensive competitor at ounce inch long small enough take anywhere two mm driver allow speaker turned loud want without experiencing distortion vibration personally i found turning speaker maximum indoors actually loud outdoors depending environment music max volume sufficient with built microphone little speaker also provides convenience hand free phone call allowing answer phone call right speaker return music automatically call finish the photive cyren utilizes new bluetooth technology connectivity a rechargeable battery built battery life match manufacturer claim hour

comparable old lg bluetooth headphone there red blue charging indicator light helpful also earbuds form fitting comfortable come different earbud size cons really wish volume control rectangle side bit smaller closer toward back neck one piece the size make good low profile headphone noticeable also paring time think bluetooth headphone bluetooth keyboard problem though also wish strap would come shirt clip like similar bluetooth headphone prevent sliding much toward either side worn around neck added one mine older headphone see pic lastly loud tone sound music video whenever pause stop it pretty annoying usually louder music video i enjoying time i pulled instruction determine tone sound disabled it would star product st last fore mentioned con improved overall good bluetooth

when i threw i immediately started blasting metallica my go test music i actually turn headphone volume substantial bass actually little much metal addled eardrum hellz yeah these great i highly recommend come little bell whistle extra earbuds usb charger really cool little hard case store as good bose headphone day tenth price one thing i admire amazon write review product whether purchase item one thing i dislike amazon even idiot post comment clearly never even bought item said real review polaroid pbt i personally eyeing ion rocker year the base model start depending seller i went local bj try ion rocker immediately fell love it pair seemlessly nice volume boast phenomenal battery life the draw back size true portability the ion rocker base model awkward cube shape stumpy handle it really designed someone vehicle transport home setting moved room room hence reason i opted pbt this true portability first little amp styled speaker loud please let negative comment discourage purchase out box speaker stand inch high light compared ion rocker it come physical button actual switch volume knob two knob control mic plugged it also three button control track phone aux access plug manually i thought cool feature there loud beeping let know unit loud beep paired it pair easily device bluetooth capability detect many people wondering battery life it excellent i gotten plus hour easily i stream music use bluetooth exclusively always went well hour plus charge charge time take approximately hour sometimes le what really set little amp speaker apart portability the carrying strap made sturdy nylon material similar strap well made back pack the strap adjustable allows nice carrying length it also come sturdy side handle attached well unit this popping daily use the edge speaker protected piece thin silver metal take everyday knock bump well the unit made sturdy particle board type material strong the matte finish make keeping unit clean easy poloroid designed little unit well the sound quality average imho no bose jbl jambox quality tinny distorted either at higher volume static easily adjusted controlling volume device unit once achieved unit handle loudness well there sufficient bass level genre music heard specifically watch volume setting device the unit ultra portable i put large back pack easily carry provided strap for something light big sound the reason star instead noticeable lag track bluetooth mode i believe unit bluetooth lag playback quality device bluetooth higher not deal breaker may annoy many listener pop sound track is device worth asking price absolutely is device good quality absolutely would i recommend unit daily use yes you definitely get money worth i owned item month issue this great sounding speaker used indoors it waterproof worry unexpected rain ruining also shockproof drop likely damaged it built flashlight one end hook end could use hang lanyard backpack something similar the button top easy work remember hold second raise lower volume simple push there switch back hard read i knock star since could eyesight i would recommend putting word black lettering instead orange though hard see the sound quality impressive this speaker get way louder i expected i notice distortion even full volume it also put lot bass i expected i really love you get foot away start cutting range fairly decent like bluetooth device something blocking signal may cut shorter distance i happy speaker would definitely recommend it look nice sound great used weather condition even shower without worrying damage i received archeer waterproof bluetooth speaker free discount exchange honest opinion i guarantee good review i rely product review shopping always give honest opinion good bad all opinion based experience product first i bought w hard earned money no one gave free review paid type one this good sound bar style speaker price it going win award best sound i needed something would fit lg um p ultrawide monitor my monitor foot long putting small pair speaker looked silly so i found i looking fits right monitor look great sound okay get pretty loud highs mids good need bass overall it good sound bar one thing note turn make weird noise like cell phone near radio static not big deal tho i got computer work i tired speaker back behind monitor reach back get volume control although made rest desktop i wanted mounted monitor i grabbed volume button move place i used heavy duty double sided mounting tape it seems perfect fit way i realize connector hole bottom might little difficult access position monitor easily raise problem sound quality decently good call impressive i basically need various computer beep chime notification audio youtube video sometimes i play music amazon music player it handy mounted like i show picture i get phone call i quickly get large volume dial crank i probably order second one home computer i get desk neatened as star say it ok nothing spectacular work important thing the sound muddy i expected i never really expect much sub speaker but reason i chose unit easily integrated way overcrowded desktop see photo i use solar powered accessory keyboard ohave place laptop keyboard it grippy bottom stay put just plug usb cable powered port headphone plug headphone jack computer done power volume controlled dial front speaker the setting i verify make sure system directing output correct device see second image this bluetooth speaker incredible the price completely affordable a lot speaker i shopping well and sound quality great it really picked high mids low clearly it much better listening music phone i also really like design rugged i love splash proof it important note different waterproof i think speaker water proof would mean submersible want submerge but built weather basic element i using shower kid bath time i affixed back wall shower side opposite shower head avoid much water exposure possible and usually play bedtime lullaby bathe child prepare bedtime it made huge difference smoothly transition bed i highly recommend amazing speaker anyone like able listen music go want reasonable durability

back the denim seems pretty sturdy look cool person plus dark color hide smudge dirt pretty easily it handle ease carrying the zipper case large zip tightly it perfect cds past i plan use travel i received sample product free honest unbiased review with two kid mess everywhere i decided ditch all dvd cd box stick everything cd binder we chose one kid cute handle jean detail small enough handle held good amount medium at first glance indeed cute the picture true life the zipper protrude bottom several inch i torn whether would pro con make zipping much easier little finger it could tucked back would bother every time fine leaving the binding seems secure zipper open close easily this would sound like love i downgrade like i pull piece plastic every dvd page see picture it biggest deal i expect something like mentioned product description take little time effort part i received free exchange trying writing honest unbiased review several year ago i owned bose wireless computer speaker i impressed speaker i think sound quality measured price bose asking however i happy report bose soundtouch series iii much better product i minor issue build first bose soundtouch series iii beast measure wide x high x deep weighs pound it run a c power battery option available the speaker come remote a c power cord one sheet quick start guide the speaker feature wi fi connection sure support wireless ac ghz connection also take advantage wired ethernet connection bluetooth reason included series ii speaker aux mm input there small display front show wireless status information song station playing the included remote control function including presets top speaker power volume presets bluetooth aux button installation initial set requires access radio via bose soundtouch app smartphone tablet computer i used iphone the app set account bose use app select individual internet radio station one available music service music library once find favorite station assigned one six presets i issue far ios version soundtouch app except non functional internet radio station see one really nice thing setup bose six presets programmed may never need app remote use preset button speaker music selections i split music option soundtouch five distinct category use bose app select individual internet radio station there large number station select around world featuring many variety music talk unfortunately quarter local station i tried work station i wanted listen available use bose app select music service the available apps deezer iheartradio pandora spotify not bad

supported bose connect music source speaker mm audio cord included it something i use much nice old technology option available sound very good like bose product detail frequency response driver used soundtouch series iii clearly two way speaker larger driver reproduce low frequency small driver reproduce high frequency this major improvement previous bose speaker used single driver produce frequency from testing speaker reproduce sound hz limit hearing khz normal listening level the overall sound bit warm obvious issue play pretty high level begin start hear distortion note sound adjusted somewhat via bass setting soundtouch app treble control other minor issues there clock alarm sleep function available since unit bit large bedroom i call minor oversight i surprised included no user manual supplied single sheet quick start a full manual available download bose website no audio spec published this make difficult decide whether soundtouch soundtouch better fit particular room power larger driver deeper bass we guess bose telling u summary i impressed bose soundtouch series iii it expensive system like bose product case i believe getting quality speaker money it large heavy well built output good sound the addition bluetooth eliminates biggest flaw series ii speaker replaces it may compete large stereo system tabletop speaker solid choice would happy sitting living room bose hit homerun as music enthusiast i picky sound quality i make short point speaker awesome as happy owner bose soundlink i got bose soundtouch even bigger sound also i wanted able play music computer home network it sound good sound clear full stereo speaker system it sound bit muffled bass tends lacking definition i mean audiophile bowers wilkins system newer definitive my closest audiophile system would old definitive speaker this speaker system us bose waveguide technology antiquated today newer sound technology it basically utilizing bass reflex technology many speaker today it channel sound channel much like nautilus bass reflex technology maximizes bass response cost definition an enclosed speaker system bass reflex port better sound but entail use woofer many speaker most speaker today mid woofer cone handle sound bass high it rare find speaker three woofer mid range tweeter usually get two another problem system bluetooth often drop connection and irritating listening complex classical piece and even iphone sitting right next that acceptable today standard my soundlink problem when compared side side soundtouch sound louder fuller soundlink but quality sound bigger much expensive component good in sense soundlink best newer larger brother better sound definition it put much sound smaller further soundlink utilize waveguide technology boxy bass sound all going spend sound system look elsewhere the definitive portable system sound way better cost little the bowers wilkins unit sound better cost denon also offer better option unit sound clearer livelier without boomy sound these option apps allow use smartphone music source if looking portability looking big sounding unit soundlink this speaker awesome the sound incredible bass strong clear

tower see picture a bit cumbersome change picture presets tv there dedicated button scroll menu get a bit pain i normally go graphic regular pc web browsing game gaming standard movie tv hopefully sony get solution next firmware when dark scene screen could bit reflective window front tv see picture when high brightness tv overcomes still i miss bit matte panel year past anyway awesome tv i looking forward keep enjoying you well i purchased husband several month ago speaker tv work well turned sound it crackly my husband wanting one living room forever i bought christmas we shopped around one great review great price we definitely see top seller we one bedroom tv well brand different model we issue either ever our flat screen tv inch set the sound crisp clear watch movie using make huge difference this great brand buy you go wrong product it easy install set my husband running time i purchased bad boy week ago local retailer this replacing sony x b last year great mid level k set however struggled dark room viewing struggled achieve deep black this set replaced panasonic vt bit small medium room up week ago vt best tv i ever owned seen but plasma inherently deep black level great native contrast offered best pop screen the x c different level the amount contrast thing unreal deep deep black retina burning brights give picture much pop like looking outside front window the full array local dimming work wonder sony dialed perfect this combination rich triliminous color k resolution display image utterly lifelike like tv better source better lifelike effect conversely though cable channel pretty since tv really show flaw even x processor but blurays k content look absolutely amazing and gaming ps ridiculous thing seriously never want leave couch so expensive i got mine sale black friday really heavy lb i never use built speaker look bad as though but put amazingly clear detailed bright picture i ever seen television absolutely recommended comparing regular speaker vizio m series tv come id say absolutely comparison my original interest sound bar dialogue much quieter action scene i would constantly adjusting volume numerous time per show movie these sound speaker solve problem hand there also great adjustment adjust bass treble surround etc another great feature notification light left side speaker since speaker display small dot help navigate various option they different brightness option know exactly adjusting option e if adjusting bass light bottom light brightest meaning bass lowest option the remote great well responsive the speaker automatically turn tv remote tv remote actually control speaker wel l i vizio tv connected optical k material displayed better tv tv market world right this brightess tv per nit anything this tv best color vibrancy anything ever seen android o buggy also wonderful easy use working properly big remote occasionally stop working come touch pad remote also go stop working tv occasionally crash unplug restart fixed update probably sound fantastic best speaker system tv market want surround sound system great start fast i docked star cause unfortunately watching lot p satellite cable broadcast tv big hard time creating good picture signal see lot artifact due image magnified make worse pq smaller since watch alot stuff probably return however blurays k stuff ur main use best tv nothing compare brightness color pop cannot stated enough never seen tv display vibrant color amazing brightness life it truly something amazing c bright one right i understand mixed review i bought mine new walmart great soundbar mile tv audio i keep mine surround setting sub awesome the optical port i use straight tv device come it nice thump the optical cable aittle thin short work great if need longer one i say get one set fool proof worry battery sub linked box without input this one might bounce floor blow back amazing system bluetooth worked phone if looking noticeable upgrade puny tv speaker mid range soundbar great these review really confuse i glad i bother researching i would put score it palm sized radio mp player sound pretty good money it picked twenty fm radio station all fm station sounded crystal clear i even extend antenna some am station picked sounding terrible i never listen am station i ordered gb micro card put song they sounded good i used head set pair ear bud i sounded good stereo mm jack on speaker even though sound loud clear like stereo sound unidirectional mono you cannot expect something tiny sound like speaker surround system it simply cannot surround having said got music breakfast sitting bar stool next sink or use break boredom painting wall room with thing i music coming rear end know i put back pocket it come charger micro sd card but people usb phone charger computer i think fast a charger designed ipads would good little thing the instruction specifies v a charger if connected usb charger play even without battery when connected computer windows usb cable computer recognize radio like camera device i put micro sd card sd adapter put computer load song it come mini stand the mystery silver color plastic ring attached strap stuck back make radio stand it look flimsy work the reason i giving star lack shuffle function gb potentially hold song no shuffle mean like one long cassette tape hold song you either skip hundred song one time get one like or remember load number punch number get directly but remember load order hundred song put i know upper limit song number punch since digit i would assume go but i many song test and many song would probably go something dinky it remembers played least start song every time you could multiple folder repeat button give choice just one song playing repeat folder entire collection i even expecting display scroll name song but shuffle i really like little radio shuffle kinda hurt so please ready dust mix tape skill last century play order important player after slight delay receiving speaker getting information meaning light get unit connected i sure product now used full week i would rate i could the sound quality excellent range good i ipod one room speaker another hear music i right next speaker it still needed charge i travel quite bit size perfect carry bag i would definitely recommend speaker not much bigger egg yet fill room rich warm clear sound well built aluminum speaker housing i impressed could even fit pocket take desk space shelve space cool thing i purchased inch rebel inch rock due amazon letting copyright music posted video take typed explanation performance one thing confusing rebel listed this mean sends different sound total channel right left bass but driver yes driver the rock mean different sound driver front left right rear left right bass at least stereo receiver world like i took flashlight grill see both fact driver cone not really confident rock really would need one speaker listed ok sound i found sound pretty similar the rock louder type loud little distorted so want clean sound rock would turn notch two by time rebels max volume peak well i would say population would content size price happy rebel in rare case using large open space time may consider rock but remember peak volume distortion both unit sound all volume level side notes they not play bt connection time you connect the speakers mm jack though limited move if unpaired say take call speaker time minute this good thing forget drain battery i inch smaller bluetooth speaker the biggest benefit nyne speaker bass second volume if want best small bt go zealot soundlion s it almost competes nyne minus bass top volume speak battery play time i would think size battery rebel would last longer volume hit helpful post helped help others in conclusion go smaller cheaper rebel update while returning rock local big box store i purchased ue megaboom due someone suggesting louder rock rebel i tell fall way short sound compared larger cheaper speaker there surprise needed debunk another review i happy purchase the megaboom sound pretty good though size so another category sure due audio rebel i able use megaboom rebel time i even hear megaboom due rebel outblasting case closed really close pound pound megaboom good though i love speaker wanted give star here thought comparing bose soundlink i likes excellent sound quality compare well bose though treble slightly le present loud volume level similar bose low end bass volume size matter great build quality feels durable all surface rubbery except metal speaker grille excellent top control arrangement large rubbery button always brightly lit unit excellent rear panel control port test button led meter indicate battery status battery last many day standby even rear switch left on much better bose sl i good speakerphone though moderate mic sensitivity requires wander far speaking bluetooth simple pair link without hesitation dislikes outdoors connection broke foot using iphone s it solid indoors i always within disappointing i get better range bose update distance better ipad air i even get normal foot bluetooth distance update upgraded phone iphone s s distance increased slightly still nowhere near claimed i find much usable overall i really like build nyne bass pro i care bigger sound important still quite portable i pleased brightly lit control pad fact battery last long left standby for money go wrong distance issue i hoping find answer now i experienced basspro long standby battery life rear switch on top switch off i unimpressed standby battery life bose this big heavy bluetooth speaker easily biggest one i it inch wide pound heavy according scale the photo show size nyne speaker compared second biggest bluetooth speaker i sony srs xb inch long pound the sony cost nyne speaker comparing speaker nyne much louder maximum usable volume distortion becomes annoying the sony however give better clarity sony usable bass booster feature time want thump thump music the nyne speaker fill good sized room music good volume the sony loud enough although sony let sync multiple speaker spread music larger area extra cost speaker course nyne multi speaker bluetooth capability the nyne bulky enough i going carry day day use even built carry handle however great time need volume like outdoor party picnic good sized group both sony nyne speaker rubberized exterior water resistance protect abuse going get outdoor use carry car neither speaker come carrying case keep clean unfortunately yes huge nyne multi language instruction sheet hassle really say much if used kind bluetooth device past thing need instruction use switch charge there special feature like equalizer bass booster multi speaker bluetooth syncing find speaker both nyne sony use non standard charger instead usb cable phone us i hate keep track charger the battery speaker tremendously bigger ipad us i know use standard charger star price reasonable usable volume speaker if plan using speaker maximum volume however i think smaller speaker much practical okay review new nyne basspro pros excellent sturdy build rubberized coating metal speaker screen solid hatch door open reveal port very large easy push button top unit has battery indicator light easy pairing turn automatically bt pairing mode also nfc good safe packaging unit well protected transport loud clear sound rechargeable battery built also charge usb device cons documentation need simplified made neat little book pamphlet instead giant folded sheet x smaller one arabic way complicated just simple one page quick start guide would great but much information better information fine the charger also complicated including multiple world plug attach onto ac unit this may good but made plastic broken pretty much luck need get replacement for something built toughness ac charger also simple tough i plan bringing large speaker trip overseas europe asia whatever it stay around home us plug unit sold us market of course star deducted people see wonderful feature travel big unit sound okay sound very subjective i personally like bass heavy speaker music especially since primarily used garage gym i want loud clear bass heavy beat power workout i would rate sound b a the bass could much heavier i bose soundlink ii th size nyne basspro honestly produce much lower low but size volume cannot compare nyne unit not even close the nyne speaker cranked loud clear bass heavy name would imply least overall i get great use its rechargeable convenient move around garage outside garage etc i doubt i utilize water resistance ability since i pool for price good deal great deal must buy certainly serve purpose the nyne speaker really great sound course primary thing want speaker i think downside compact unit would carry around easily backpack i sure i would want take anywhere nice outdoor party home it good hand grip make easier carry decide lug beach camping it pound fairly large x x inch i included photo iphone sitting front it paired easily iphone control sound volume either iphone speaker the great benefit bluetooth speaker keep phone docked device it say splash proof ideal outdoor use i test option update i trouble pairing iphone i often forget device iphone remove device speaker memory reboot device connects i removing two star sometimes hassle enough i want take time connect i use speaker i know older phone connects bluetooth device without issue i believe problem speaker there plethora reason people may interested bluetooth speaker i included personal reason buying product others may understand i looking other reviewer different motivation i recommend identify feature important making purchase i primarily looking portability affordability sound quality battery life i using speaker go small party around house range better speaker pros sound quality it critical feature discus one i qualified i faint memory bluetooth speaker compare i know i pleased one far the sound surprisingly clear never muffled rarely distorted some quiet sound instrument drop presence louder layered instrument sharing similar frequency common nearly speaker just remember want true audio quality look bluetooth speaker this audiophile equipment it convenience auxiliary input usb output port these favourite feature often missing bluetooth speaker the auxiliary port allows physically connect music player lacking bluetooth mm audio cable the usb output port allows power charge usb device phone tablet the manufacturer also explicitly list battery capacity mah enough purpose nfc bluetooth pairing easy anyone complains product confusing set read included manual product description although may entirely intuitive feature device thoroughly documented always read manual using reviewing product very affordable at time writing rocktech pt bluetooth speaker average for part overall quality better worse i might expect price i might consider increasing budget future complete rugged feeling intuitive speaker i satisfied purchase cons the power pairing voice volume cannot changed though i come expect many low end bluetooth device any volume louder silence notification loud problem live the soft rubber frame around speaker snug pulled away i suspect rubber exterior first thing fail normal condition this especially applies rubber lid protecting usb aux port the lid fit loosely attached thin piece rubber i expect lid first thing rip seem replaceable the soft rubber dust magnet this minor drawback rubber serf practical purpose protection dust affect aesthetic speaker function it easy enough brush particulate matter however the button control volume also control track playback next previous this incredibly annoying i hate manufacturer combine button i always prefer dedicated volume track skip button combining button make fine tuned volume control difficult without risking accidentally skipping rewinding song this appropriate feature party especially guest want adjust volume it far easy accidentally skip song instead want crank this far least favorite feature speaker i fully aware beforehand though i knew i getting extra to clear button exactly work rewind skip song simply tap forward back button to adjust volume long press hold desired button minimum second hear volume change although manufacturer claim speaker waterproof protected water submersion rated ipx this rating appears product title description technically know exactly getting however verbiage bit deceitful misleading an ipx rated device mean protected splashing water direction please look closely ip rating truly need submersible speaker i strongly discourage use speaker depth water shower included i need purpose non issue may important others overall i love speaker purpose easy charge work great besides drawback mentioned affordable happy speaker hunting update the flip sound better charge bought time pair together much clearer charge overall bass whole sound charge muddled compared clear flip but together sound great previous charge sound pretty good self i paired w flip together sound unbelievable i think i may like flip better charge time tell i like i carry flip easily hand near thick charge paired together great the jbl flip medium sized speaker great sound inside nature sadly come well charger sub cable supplied i highly suggest want good speaker personally i cheap i refused buy full price discounted price i would try scoop price reduced especially considering fact charger supplied so thing sound really good wanted something super portable loud enough house party works perfect my roommate got ue boom cyber monday sale only paid and agreed sound little better also agreed pay full price ue boom flip even though water proof thinks so twice much flip does sound twice good not even close maybe louder i gotta say my early impression quite positive speaker from way packaged button layout sound quality good compact bluetooth speaker i think find price point it appears well built battery hold give many good year service i come market compact splash proof bluetooth speaker last one tdk a started experiencing charging issue i unable source replacement battery it set benchmark sound quality general size level speaker deep thumping bass ability produce crisp clean high use eq box actually rather muddy lack ability after short lived experiment smaller altec lansing died warranty i set eye model form factor rating from get go jbl good job first impression the box ship well made almost nice inexpensive speaker the instruction simple point includes usb charging cable wall wart you need plug computer usb port use third party micro usb charger want charge wall outlet setup breeze paired successfully ancient android tablet second of note row white dot light power share button indicates battery level as far i tell charging top light never burn continuously flash like always charging even done kind odd but anytime use press button light shine showing relative battery level my early experience indicate run approximately hour single charge moderate volume level the range bluetooth also quite good i able move good foot away multiple wall device speaker minimal dropout my biggest worry speaker tube shape it say anywhere whether kind padding footing keep rolling ledge my main use place shower dry narrow ledge luckily rather invisible useful indentation operating side if jbl logo facing slightly upward facing angle rest without rolling away even slightly imperfect surface it also stand end facing side speaker still heard thanks tiny undulation molding allowing sound escape it thoughtful touch still sound best side you hear much way stereo separation small speaker still fill small room sound somewhat faithfully source material obviously bass lacking due overall side device careful placement corner near wall allows resonate better it come anywhere close deep downright rich punchy bass tdk instead sounding bit plastic muddy i think issue people unless love bass heavy music i would definitely worry blowing side woofer either volume high something hitting completely exposed this device waterproof appears well sealed splash proof duty i using shower come direct contact running water i splashed little bit used wet finger change volume far good the plastic rubber door seal aux charging jack thick tight fitting any water get speaker grille fabric bead soak nice it easy dry water drip the power share button flat volume phone bluetooth button raised tactile make easy hand free use many situation additional feature ability share via share button appears hourglass like glyph get firmware upgrade it two sharing mode letting two jbl speaker act independent left right channel party mode play music equally multiple device i test it bit gimmicky i know many speaker after purchase i able successfully upgrade firmware via jbl connect smartphone app it list change took good five minute transferring data bluetooth complete but least ability overall i think jbl winner particular model side side flip predecessor one definitely look sound better although battery life greatest i expect improve initial charge sound quality high side good fairly rugged side speaker excepted affordable if break year two i definitely hooked jbl lineup seem much right others cutting corner sound quality design the jbl flip small portable bluetooth speaker definitely exceeded expectation to start packaging product simple yet elegant the speaker come magnetic flip box comprised speaker tangle free flat usb cable manual there also small string attached speaker removed desired the speaker many feature easily make best bluetooth speaker price range straight box speaker lasted hour volume although company advertises hour playtime i noticed volume speaker last hour full charge i use speaker hour every day seems speaker low battery volume slowly decrease however maintain excellent sound quality the speaker also connected aux cable i use speaker whenever i go play beach volleyball great job filling entire court music i absolutely amazed high volume produced small portable speaker i also love speaker definitely made take beating obviously want drop speaker hard floor great strong build quality take drop two overall product fantastic outdoor speaker since splash proof manages pump small debris get radiator i sand slip side speaker radiator located slight shake song high bass bass radiator managed push sand the four button speaker concealed well since color speaker they feel clicky easy use i used bluetooth speakerphone feature couple time worked perfectly voice quality good mic speaker pretty strong well since pick lot noise i foot away friend told could still hear voice clearly bluetooth paring also fairly simple activated simple click button my favorite feature speaker fantastic bass provides the external passive bass radiator side speaker look awesome action also provide nice low bass the bass radiator also seem enhance volume provide great listening experience overall opinion jbl flip best portable blue tooth speaker provides great sound quality long lasting battery classy look at price point sub speaker exceeds many speaker regard sound quality loudness incredible build quality many people always ask i use bike i made basket thick foam super glue avoid mountain road vibration everything else including volume control smartphone tough rate high class yet area improvement might addressed expensive speaker but case despite good speaker area could better first great packaging doesn come much speaker charger manual looks great box i got black about size tall boy oz beer human boy has button connecting bluetooth volume pairing speakerphone aux charging port nicely covered silicon that cover seems secure likely break contributes splash proof design speaking design thing sharp you see pic of course everyone love passive bass radiator end thing bump it compact nylon loop hang secure clip great versatility portability design allows sound speaker works best jbl logo facing can set vertical horizontal either way slant slightly speaker facing kind weird first i like pretty lightweight probably bit heavier tall boy high quality material construction does cheap feel competitor knock offs it like speaker cloth rubberized plastic first impression extremely loud warm full distortion i desire need crank max could handle person party background music dance party it bass heavy pretty clear mids bit treble from fairly extensive research best sound class almost compete bigger model for example difference big jambox great worth spending difference imo impressed bluetooth connection been foot away door shut worked perfect battery life seems great i hear go hour moderate level i need blaring i taking advantage speakerphone pairing cool function i read pair different jbl speaker like xtreme maybe charge i read flip auto shut minute unsure would assume a issue the bass mids high sound separated only get smooth balanced sound song sounds different many song spotify has sound outdoor concert even indoors the passive bass radiator genius give good thump particularly bassy song quite serviceable natural bass sound bass almost disappeared song ridiculously deep bass uncommonly low bass thing typically thump no supportive app eq i think using spotify eq improves sound i would love see companion app eq alarm sleep function remote on off has mirror volume device e g turn way speaker device go mute kind loud on off sound pairing sound lowest volume low enough overall i really happy thing nothing touched price range i noticed lot love ue roll boom sound like zero bass i prefer balanced sound get balance need something handle bass overall sound pretty pleasing you blown away size i convinced money better le money disappointed picky sound i love see added feature smoother sound i convinced best speaker buy unless spend also higher go sometimes bigger device lose portability worth saving afford yet worth saving money eyeballing something little pricier i came amazon buy jbl flip based widely positive review desire speaker i could use outdoors without worrying much sudden shower dust hazard element while searching however i came across anker newest entry soundcore sport xl given price general satisfaction anker amazon solid return policy i decided give speaker try i note soundcore sport xl probably comparable jbl charge given unit usb port let charge phone device the flip charging output port if want shortest possible answer we keeping flip giving soundcore xl gift but almost coin toss going stay sound i wanted speaker enough volume modest outdoor gathering meet criterion though flip probably touch louder sound good enough i mind playing house i also biased today tendency consumer speaker emphasize bass response every frequency range if like music boom i going like speaker my wife i listened across wide range music classical folk hip hop pop hard rock trying get sense liked better the answer turned depends the flip definitely flat audibly soundcore within limit small speaker flip seems emphasize bass treble end spectrum high treble even sounded unnaturally sizzly couple song in others vocalist almost seemed bit buried rest mix though never disturbingly we talking nuance ear may different experience the soundcore definitely flat sounding it produce much bass flip necessarily bad thing never sizzling issue treble it sound even people used punchy sound emphasized consumer speaker headphone manufacturer however may find music lack bit life which prefer ultimately depended playing folk country music clearly mixed intent playing radio often preferred soundcore more current pop rock hip hop sounded better u jbl in final count jbl came top much i listening day switching back forth every often i find i inclined toward jbl i certainly mind soundcore size build the soundcore sport xl x x inch wrapped feel like sturdy slightly rubbery plastic it definitely heavy hand make feel confident hold rigorous outdoor use the biggest issue design i found constantly grabbing bass port back includes metal cover stretchy membrane passive woofer i idea pushing cover would damage passive woofer disconcerting the flip x inch covered dense fabric hard plastic end it slightly lighter hand cylindrical shape make comfortable pick carry around it feel solidly built quite tank like soundcore the flip dual bass port end way unless odd approach picking cylinder fantastic bluetooth speaker compete quality higher end wireless speaker i compared side side bose mini bose definitely beat quality however half price get wet durable another great feature pairing ability flip fantastic everyone office one great speaker great price i one day already write review the bass line thump loud awesome i bit skeptical star fully charged i got wow huge sound i thought i bought bose if looking

well represented individual sound artist easy pin point air front i sure precise placement would really let gel least imaging i picked i wanted know sort bass could accomplished small speaker subwoofer highly touted stellar candidate application while do produce good deal bass still left lot meat bone depending genre music might prefer subwoofer floor standing tower may needed i say good

speaker even weave woofer cone angle hair hand mold tweeter star dust still capable much some track really stood there handful track i found notoriously difficult many speaker play cleanly especially higher volume the b passed flying color elton john mad man across the water album name this song noisy bit reoccurs listening much going high volume many woofer distort ugly mess the b remained

pink floyd diablo swing orchestra in opinion speaker play better small ensemble track much going time very nice acoustic guitar violin piano large orchestral piece quite well although i thought percussion including timpani kettle rather subdued they present presence i used hearing larger speaker vocals male female seemed quite forward perhaps little shouty not ideal considering two driver relatively small box b still good upright bass even electric four string bass shoved background this horrible used listen specific track bass presentation may bit disappointed get used buy floor stander subwoofer the b bass quite well rather letting equal partner musical marriage bookshelf speaker general habit relegating bass track underlying foundation composition honesty probably right artist intended first place good price that depends want these would hard beat justifiably higher price size range budget room better quality floor stander anyway if live without deepest end musical frequency spectrum portrayed realistically may suffice even without subwoofer photo b stand front homemade two way open baffle specifically tuned reproduce charles mingus bass impressive sound good build quality feel weighty enough feel like like worth bit money one best sounding speaker ever listened but why easily scratched i got day go guess the thing look like i owned year coz easy scratch regularly trim nail keep away thing wanna maintain flawless skin i bought speaker tested aginst klipsch speakers the elacs seemed fuller sound mid low range klipsch noticeably better high range overall i think elacs better speaker although one two woofer set distort medium high volume i think i return replacement edit the distortion seem disappeared couple week i think i needed break period im happy speaker elac debut b versus klipschorns decisions decision yes elacs good nuff said these speakers are incredible honestly i never thought something great price could sound majestic i pair back channel surround system way look feel sound like if market set bookshelf speaker time stop looking make purchase i promise not disappoint you would need spend close x amount even come close sound quality produce as i returning stage youth quality sound important music stopped know i invested good record player receiver good expensive left fund quality speaker i research asked question listened plenty speaker etc felt good lol i decided elac b debut series never regreted they sound crisp tight even high volume my ear believe quality sound smaller set speaker price you beat price point i glad system come together fraction i thought would cost imho elac legit winner speaker definetly punch weight class i never heard clear speaker i used jbl bookshelf speaker i thought top notch to elac

amp auralex acoustic pad my home office relatively small room high ceiling x w ceiling the space i speaker top desk hutch see pic i purchased acoustic pad dampen vibration hutch i also needed small inexpensive amp power so i purchased dayton audio apa it low cost relatively small i admit i doubt setup thought worth try i extremely happy entire setup the speaker sound great the amp provides enough power speaker size room however room larger i want bigger amp could really push speaker full potential the bass sufficient taste mids high equally satisfying overall i extremely happy entire

wield around party even carry music around house the strap fairly close guitar strap making easy replace guitar strap find guitar strap fit style however recommend since jbl xtreme strap seems like handle plenty abuse clip side actually heavy duty upon taking jbl xtreme box obvious jbl included carrying strap i fairly large hand large enough hold basketball one hand i barely carry xtreme one hand the combination torpedo like structure weight make fairly hard get good grip hurry this complaint i think speaker however plan strapping giving permanent home shelf mean ignore worry taking look speaker reveals seriously cool idea i never seen on top speaker find two anchor strap placed these anchor made steel plastic ensuring take ton abuse showing sign breaking if i brave i would experiment much weight anchor handle i say seems anchor likely outlast strap given if happens strap easily replaced the anchor placed two indentation well making super easy simple place strap xtreme need buy jbl

idol the front speaker includes large bright orange jbl logo two speaker side logo i love orange jbl logo show people around room make speaker actually make easy see dark at dusk jbl logo bright enough shine light sun make easier find without logo i see coming handy especially summer night time campfire the front facing speaker perfectly spaced great sound field while cannot recreate surround sound speaker placed far enough easy time figuring coming left right speaker on two side torpedo shaped speaker find mirror image deign two side bass radiator speaker these bass radiator include jbl logo gray finish look high end move bass especially turned loud these thing seriously move bass much i ever thought possible bluetooth speaker no worry blowing bass radiator jbl implemented cut point make sure never worry when bass becomes bass radiator handle bass cut lower level you notice bass heavy song sound turned way max outside hear implementation even le around bass radiator jbl also included indentation stand xtreme side rock this make sure bass radiator covered break still able move air well while i much rather like xtreme sit upright could nice implementation wanted set xtreme large cup holder something similar underneath speaker find model number speaker rubber foot provides millimeter clearance case bit water able run speaker this keep speaker sitting water the foot also magnificent job keeping speaker moving bass really kick even music loud could go speaker never moved even millimeter impressive towards front find light battery indicator when light go speaker dead jbl thought everything inclusion turning light unless press button speaker battery level getting dangerously really low this save battery life even minuscule margin the jbl xtreme come blue red black three grey accent found n side undercarriage speaker set color apart stitching found throughout speaker personally i never seen bluetooth speaker feature uniform stitched body like jbl xtreme judging oft benefit provides easy see could technology future not stitched pattern help gripping speaker one hand make xtreme splash proof i run speaker sink i amazed find water bead directly stitching

make xtreme charge via micro usb like love much this power draw speaker this speaker produce watt power loudest level double i ever seen lot power find lot power draw when used plugged jbl xtreme use power micro usb cable us charge speaker meaning even plugged speaker would eventually run battery not huge mah battery would take age charge via micro usb luckily jbl included proprietary charger jbl xtreme i know thinking ew proprietary charger let put mind ease letting know speaker last incredible hour single charge this make problem needing charger available time fairly non existent hour long time bluetooth speaker long fact phone might die even depleted that xtreme come jbl included one two usb port charge device you charge phone tablet i even charged drone battery xtreme problem the charging speed differs however two thing plugged when one thing plugged xtreme charge phone amp two thing charging amp shared usb port giving amp per usb port if xtreme charge time jbl xtreme power eve course drop charging phone well hour time might drop hour depending phone battery level size battery phone this hour battery life also fluctuate loud speaker louder speaker power speaker draw quicker battery depletes this speaker need firmware update first buy easy update all need download jbl app iphone android go step the whole process take right around minute make jbl xtreme sound even

hulked version jbl charge all i know speaker well worth disappointed i liked speaker much i bought second jbl extreme pair first jbl extreme i bought christmas the loudness clarity factor satisfactory bass loud drown treble would bose soundlink mini i two ue megabooms hold candle jbl extremes the ue megabooms relegated playing ambiance music house good job these extremes well fill house music sound satisfying bass clear treble good mid range battery time the battery life good they needed recharged hour continuous playing volume level time recharging time about hour sometimes le jbl connect these speaker consistently connect using jbl connect system i also paired extreme charge flip if jbl would implement unlimited wireless pairing would great for ability connect two jbl wireless speaker together use connect system anything better probably keeping entertained satisfied however i heard system called minirig us two small satellite speaker standalone mated subwoofer system also satellite daisy chained unlimited amount pairing update april well i since acquired marshal kilburn pair libratone zipps zipp mini bang olufsen beolit all sound much better xtreme what jbl xtreme lack well shaped bass envelope low bass range it none existent the xtreme also fair amount bass boost muddies overpowers sound punch it muted external eq for i ipod touch i apply bass reducer eq option mind needed time certain song album lower bass predominate like oldie fever madonna verdict i still keeping they bring smile face i pair two xtreme select stereo output via jbl connect app they outdoor music speaker i yard work washing car bar b q ing outdoor thingys they feel home pushing tune tailgate pickup little fear exposed element con if jbl would provide hand strap addition shoulder strap

still quite satisfied i admit though i bluetooth portable speaker surpass jbl sound quality i particularly keen libratone zipp zipp mini they better balance bass response go quite bit lower extremes however big plus jbl bluetooth portable speaker i jbl outdoor friendly water resistant rugged comparison portable speaker so would disappointed main sound environment would outdoors pool cookout family gathering backyard if lack speaker reference really mind sound come jbl i cannot undersell idea two when paired jbl connect app linked stereo mode pretty awesome sound system outdoor event well i would even say indoors well cheers i currently infinity one ue megaboom ue roll bose mini ive also used jbl charge jbl charge jbl charge jbl flip jbl flip jbl flip beats pill xl i picked jbl xtreme compared speaker play louder clearer treble stronger bass it clearly better speaker everything else i mentioned one exception observation bose mini stronger deeper bass lower volume anything else i used including jbl xtreme things get interesting i compare xtreme nyne bass sell price flip the nyne produce significantly lower deeper bass xtreme nynes treble go higher well the issue nyne lack mid range frequency the xtreme produce midrange sound accurate natural nyne the nyne sound like us high frequency tweeter along one ported woofer the end result boosted bass boosted treble recessed mids xtreme sounding like much flatter frequency response nyne with said imo music sound better nyne music sound better xtreme the nyne would better choice plan stick speaker corner room leave time the nynes bass response impressive placed corner certainly impressive xtreme i played bass test track i found youtube i consistently found nynes bass response lower stronger xtremes bass response when compared nyne xtreme mid range impact presence much portable play louder cost twice much i usually listen classic rock i find nyne impact playing type music this tough call i might return xtreme keep nyne i really need another portable speaker i feel nyne much better value jbl xtreme output fantastic sound barely heard distortion loudest volume nice balance treble bass i big jambox previously sound much better comparison even output bit volume well the hidden compartment input big awkward use bad since i dealing much plus add little bit splash proof protection speaker whole it slightly bigger heavier typical bluetooth speaker would get range big jambox bose soundlink iii ue megaboom sound trade get great now crazy maniac like like dance speaker one hand drunken night party convention probably need curl day i feel comfortable holding one hand due size weight whereas i could comfortably hold big jambox pseudo dancing not mention dual radiator side device make essentially impossible hold device side music playing although badass visually but super nitpicking i obviously special case extremely special circumstance portability wise still fit backpack completely fine plus included shoulder strap genius even bag relatively easy carry around all looking bluetooth speaker price range good portability seems like brainer best sounding device i heard date class this neat little portable bluetooth speaker doss as see video i posted easy use it quick pair sound quality nice the color attractive i purchase different color green orange purple i call mine candy green

disclaimer i received discount exchange honest review this alter opinion anyway wow incredible sound ive come expect pioneer my current vehicle seen two set alpines type e type s lacked certain

surprisingly outstanding low bass note uncommon speaker seriously ive used alpines kenwoods jvcs boss rockfords kickers etc vehicle year best speaker pioneers one i baja also way thank pioneer outstanding product purchased used open box deal le i yet install fj cruiser i expect usual excellent quality pioneer update review installed tested amazing quick easy upgrade f xlt crew cab replaced door speaker ea highs super crisp nice full low end tone i noticed bass sound much fuller streaming bluetooth usb sync thumb drive highly recommend upgrade awesome bang buck there great youtube video get job done quick efficiently attached pic pioneer way compared stock version awww yes i replaced factory speaker supercrew way pioneer tsg r speaker i lost bass everything distorted even factory headunit i tried add power hit proper rms got worse i ordered installed minute hige difference right away plenty bass easily shake rear view mirror the mids exceptional treble smooth clear i planning adding tweeter i think i each speaker running watt rms thing sing can wait break if ford speaker get you disappointed i promise this review logitech z bold bluetooth i looking bluetooth connected speaker i getting feed back thru speaker outlet port computer no big deal since chromebox bluetooth capability first initial thought speaker bit lager expected almost inch tall bit wider inch bass box x inch deep i initially purchased due fact bluetooth remote speaker volume control pod installation snap absolutely issue pairing bluetooth i using speaker week i thoroughly impressed first speaker rock sound quality exceptional especially price range bass response solid muddy also ability adjust bass response prefer le bass having volume control finger tip wonderful add speaker i doubt i could speaker without cord length adequate tradition desktop set placing speaker right left monitor bass box foot if looking basic bass speaker set home office really go wrong speaker the quick take the logitech z bold sound wireless speaker system good compact powered speaker system logitech made number good design choice producing system fit space look good provide good music get fairly loud audio quality the logitech z sound good get loud system size the bass fill low end make music sound natural smaller speaker sound balance missing mid bass anything hz the size power sub going produce heavy bass realistic expectation but give natural tone music control pod a small wired control pod part system this provides nice use volume control good feel it also power switch handy headphone jack bluetooth button connection the bass control back subwoofer convenient also unusual setup note upward angle base satellite speaker improves audio quality directs sound toward ear in music treble higher frequency directional it sound best axis along line running straight center satellite speaker cone ideally want satellite pointed ear distance ear set mind low frequency hand directional so flexibility place subwoofer more generally system set big effect audio quality so experiment find sound best situation looks i find speaker attractive i rather simple design attract attention the color medium dark gray depending light definitely black specifications the speaker i received state watt rms watt left right speaker watt sub that good amount power audio system medium size smaller room it go without saying going feel bass though the official physical specification follows satellite height x width x depth x x weight lb subwoofer h x w x d x x weight lb control pod h x w x d x x weight oz wireless input streaming music music enjoyment i owned lot audio equipment year cheap high end but nothing given anything close happiness music enjoyment i gotten using wireless input music it let play music i kitchen car vacation i enjoy often adding streaming service put incredible amount music fingertip but said for best quality sound use the wired input unless using aptx offered product even better apple airplay get consistently high quality sound wireless input connection an mm auxiliary input cable included because bluetooth falls short on audio quality the convenience bluetooth great especially background music listening situation noise like car but paying attention music notice standard bluetooth specification fall short audio quality couple reason the audio encoded transmitted via bluetooth decoded converted audio signal but bluetooth device bandwidth computing power produce high quality encoded audio stream quality lost process internet stream mp itunes aac already encoded decoding encoding decoding audio create audible noise especially without high quality encoder second encoding many song sound fine especially low volume at higher volume may sound flat and noticeable number song exceed limit standard bluetooth specification capture sound distorted compare wired and bluetooth before you judge audio quality i see lot comment audio quality bluetooth speaker i suggest find challenging track norah jones sunrise compare sound wired connection v bluetooth connection using wired connection let judge speaker take bluetooth audio process more generally trying evaluate audio quality different system choose track know well know supposed sound like play track different system alternatives bigger and more expensive with music always get better sound quality larger speaker it simply matter physic speaker so space accomodate larger speaker consider sound quality important compact size and noticeably better sound quality willing spend system but logitech z fit many market looking compact simple le expensive a few photos i attached photo try show thing product listing the instruction simple enough shown flap box the input rear subwoofer fairly simple there audio rca connection want pas signal onto another device the subwoofer port left side give least inch space place wall side cabinet the control pod volume power bluetooth connection headphone jack i recently bought z system i always liked logitech speaker the build quality great produce decent sound experience i disappointed system nice channel setup little knob volume control really nicely designed engineered smooth rotating the speaker produce great sound high level lacking bass overall good system money i got set dining room i hear podcasts newscast music home office neighboring room kitchen set easy fast pairing smooth the sound plenty loud i keeping bass set tad past mid way the speaker sound great music talk clear loud this third set logitech speaker i finally found the set one the reason best wireless bluetooth being tethered wired set practical when i take phone far away room house sq foot signal may drop bit reach quite far completely dropped thus far surprisingly robust sound desktop package please refer photo i long time logitech fan expectation fairly high the speaker nicely packaged easy set wordless instruction neophyte printed flap box impossible miss opened the bass unit surprisingly thin given sound small footprint the left right speaker heavier look the control puck bluetooth connection button press three second scout around bluetooth source it also got switch entire face volume control there bass control back bass i left halfway the bluetooth connection functional pale comparison wired connection the novelty really worth my understanding bluetooth intended carry sound for whatever reason wired connection much better plenty wire separate channel the sound good desktop setup i mean i listened song i familiar instrument nuanced shaded lack better word distinct separate i never heard better sound system size really impressive nothing muddy blurry bluetooth aside sound much better previous desktop speaker solution i tried hard compare this genuinely good sound it going fill room outstanding personal sound solution i fan headphone earbuds ideal this would make excellent gift star cable half length pair logitechs i replacing not impressed buy rca extension mm extension either really logitech also sound exactly pair i addition bass control mid level bass the subwoofer also narrow connection back port side it bit odd they made firing sub rear port they look great though great option add piece set fluance this hat pretty cool i get jam music kid bus stop morning i enjoy fact i listen music head phone cold i

multiple room fill home its going user preference hear phantoms stereo likely going want keep way mono leaf something desired i prefer single room i get full experience phantom single setup its tough go back single setup hear dual setup work stereo the issue sound quality level rather experience ive noted review speak get better experience money in term single setup i see argument if talking better total price dual setup i disagree a single phantom without doubt fill room undistorted clear audio in term size outperforms everything ive tested its fair say a single phantom easiest cleanest way experience high quality audio you build comparable sounding system similar price multiple larger audio component having audio spread throughout room give pieced together solution benefit stereo pros sound exceptional loud enough fill large open space i townhome rarely put fill room great undistorted sound with said much power small apartment unless hate neighbor the size give added benefit mobility design vacuum cleaner i completely disagree they beautiful compact accent compliment every room home the small design appeases obsessive compulsive size i rearrange without major adjustment

the devialet user forum robust helpful in experience type community push envelope lead development enhancement ultimately aiding product success i faith wireless connectivity improve this speaker designed biking mind really nice little speaker it inch threaded mount hole compatible wide array accessory theoretically mounted bike also lot thing overall i really like speaker though one two minor potential con for sound quality purpose i compared similarly priced competing product house marley em ja mi wireless bluetooth speaker chant bt sport midnight i speaker time love head head marley speaker little bit bass little clarity separation high low get little bit louder the hercules speaker slightly smaller difference expect world apart hercules lag tad behind slightly bigger marley what hercules marley inch mount that open lot possibility mounting hercules giving lot flexibility active use the hercules also come wrist strap lanyard whereas marley come carabiner clip being round marley fit nicely cup bottle holder design hercules allows i found hercules plenty loud kind use made you host dance party plenty volume recreational personal use it handle pretty well way full blast hint muddling top volume though enough detract the hercules rated ip meaning keep incidental dust water you want submerge rain splash etc issue the build quality solid nice rubber protective pad end the unit nice light the one design feature i dislike power button you open rubber cover flap access physical button i would much preferred touch button power like one unit volume bluetooth control it big deal button outside would convenient other i love design the triangular shape sporty let speaker sit equally well end side pairing speaker breeze neat feature pair two device i paired phone son phone worked great pause music one phone play switch source lastly hercules provides good range bluetooth signal i able keep signal couple room away home all i like speaker lot it sound good loud size build excellent camera style mount really kicker i definitely using biking along personal use home play if i choosing based sound alone i would get marley due slight edge sound but close enough i choose hercules chance use mount big thumb not long ago wireless speaker talk town due smartphones limitation weak built speaker a small external wireless speaker provided improvement became le

connection wireless power connection wired sound analysis just like i know expect i opened zeppelin wireless packaging box i sure expect i hit play phone paired speaker there one adjective i rarely use sound description visceral good reason when come bass i usually hear ear monitor non basshead full size headphone wireless speaker i tested past with zeppelin wireless i felt bass deep rich natural visceral bass i take step back appreciate no i talking pounding sloppy sub woofer bass overpowers rest sound spectrum zeppelin wireless tight bass performance deep textured sub bass rumble hear far away tight punchy mid bass i honestly expect dynamic speaker a warm organic mids clear detailed presentation full body lower mids detailed natural upper mids beautiful vocal rendition treble extended well defined clear crisp airy performance typical natural sound smooth organic i found soundstage expansion average performance speaker exactly holographic d effect some people describe experience listening quality full size speaker stage surrounded orchestra with zeppelin wireless sound expansion definitely better wireless speaker i heard past except riva turbo x surround mode i call middle action felt like front stage with full size speaker physical separation considering individual left right cabinet placed apart acoustic room sound reflecting wall create convincing spatial effect here physical separation l r side still confined within single speaker cabinet in house open main floor plan living dining family kitchen kid playroom with speaker placed corner farthest room whole entire st floor filled music even bass came deep enough surprisingly i went upstairs bedroom i still able hear sound clear i went downstairs basement powerful sound zeppelin wireless filled entire house if i try put zeppelin wireless speaker i recently tested nothing really come close direct competition ue boom much weaker power category lacking sub bass thinner sound the bose soundlink series plenty sub bass enough power overall clarity b w t pretty good max w compare zeppelin also sound colored riva turbo x impress w power sound leaner fill room space way zeppelin bass go deep mid bass slower overall sound brighter le organic conclusion when i reviewing headphone daps i often bring principle diminishing return sometime doubling price brings marginal sound improvement end buyer price premium worth zeppelin wireless expensive wireless speaker i tested date doubling price previous favorite t turbo x if looking portable rechargeable audio speaker focusing purely sound quality i honestly tell zeppelin wireless sound least twice good two speaker keep mind zeppelin not portable require plugged wall since internal battery also powerful rather big small room but space accommodate latest masterpiece legendary design studio bowers wilkins able experience performance truly premium full size speaker sound fraction cost wireless phone tablet my wish b w able capture sound performance zeppelin wireless package portable wireless footprint perhaps t i got mine b w directly door i like unit very clear precise midrange sort disappointing bass woofer the bass catch quality rest sound higher volume experience one thing bug zeppelin i use spotifyconnect alienware computer sometimes music cut completely second i wondering wireless zeppelin loses touch wireless signal maybe i need check firmware update in case i love design zep add really nice look sound room update unit produce excellent bass volume the component zep obviously needed broken so i say i love unit unqualifiedly nice well made cable like wire cable sleeve the banana connector nice tight not likely come weight cable stars stars star i actually switched back forth star star so i pro con go i know technical information reviewer review based someone listens music needed bluetooth speaker small portable looked nice enough set open using room lil log house pro the music crisp enough fact music i listening i never heard part music i little speaker it go pretty loud well i huge speaker big suitcase kind party package karaoke machine little kef muo sound good almost loud i hide work room i big one bigger one grandiose idea since large performs better teehee i listened different kind music feel sounded lumineers techno madonna u sounded clear the size portable there photo next iphone see size comparison it dense little machine heavy size good want set end instead lengthwise easy easy set connected bluetooth ipad iphone quickly easily note mine charged box i charge first otherwise try connect keep beeping a nice looking little machine the blue vivid deep color this would look unobtrusive anywhere home cons it priced i see lowered that still little steep budget though huge one i i definitely choose little kef muo huge one bigger mean better come performance the ad indicates battery last hour well i charged overnight first time hour battery went am pm almost exactly hour so i next charged hour battery lasted almost exactly hour this contiuous play still i think would last longer hour i may rarely need time i want play time i charged fully i uplugged i going see long battery last playing music i curious i come back report there way i found adjust treble bass said i rarely adjust thing sometimes i want there app i downloaded music playlist perhaps control i explored yet though i guessing all i pleased speaker if battery lasted longer price reach i even comfortable star i gave star i ask cost factor speaker and i say i pleased except battery if advertise last hour i think last longer half i recognize ad may mean unplugged may last hour unless play continuously last quite long still misleading i received kef muo wireless bluetooth speaker late last week within minute i playing incredible music speaker system flat greatness the sound crisp vibrant aesthetically really great speaker fit anywhere house office the small instruction book enough picture figure set i admit i confused app download i downloaded wrong app first time kef setup app wrong one i finally found kef muo app downloading i business the instruction booklet way bit confusing maybe confused as far distance i literally across house could operate system iphone i changed song volume etc crisp clear music controlled several room away the color one i vibrant blue see picture i attached great it appears well made i see great christmas holiday gift age this type product i would buy family friend sure personally i audiophile headphone year heard plenty hi end headphone ether c hd hd lcd lcd lcd xc t d th x i kind sensitive sound quality make easier tell speaker bad before i begin review i need say reason i looking bluetooth speaker i want hear relaxation music help sleep which mean good even low volume so i compare speaker volume i enjoy detailed clear open sound weighted mid treble reasonable bass basshead simply want loudest speaker review probably help much since i already know im looking i passed speaker without good treble price range example bose b w mm this first pair desktop speaker i ever owned year i use mm reference mm probably best desktop speaker market size design sound still kill bluetooth speaker every aspect lol kef muo probably best hi fi bluetooth speaker market around the word hi fi massively abused year to hi fi mean good sound quality sound natural real instead artificial unreal my way test hi fi play symphony symphony requires much separation clarity treble extension dynamic soundstage transient response quality pop music clarity mid bass maybe treble the mid b o a similar muo treble muo add air sound improve overall clarity a even close mm however i think treble worth extra i tested symphony difference day night a sound muffle instrument narrowed together muo much better lack dynamic for vocal i think kef push mid front sound sound really clear even feel emotion singer sound sometimes on hand sound quality kef muo best playing low volume it really interesting find seems sound quality muo almost volume go different rest the con kef lack bass i really wish muo little bit deep bass b o a to honest i struggled a muo lot end a truly worth price because pan like design sound a heard evenly every corner room the bass pretty good size mid also clear treble ok hard compare kef muo the con a sound feel real narrow maybe pan like design mono output sound separation enough music like symphony sound natural enough might good pop treble extension enough someone like might call smooth neutral and i found best volume a sound quality changed significantly overall a well worth price offer pretty good deal sound design treble muo a mid muo a volume muo a volume bass a muo separation muo a low volume muo a hight volume muo a jbl xtreme if need speaker fill sound every corner house room buy one the sound tone xtreme kind smart v shape sound energy low treble mid give wow first impression however listen long time feel tired ik multimedia iloud the sound accurate i image response curve iloud must straight line compared others sound really boring without tone characteristic no outstanding treble mid back sound outstanding bass i think iloud like studio equipment tone turning personal speaker denon envaya mini to honest i know people like the sound probably muffin put paper kef muo i hardly feel treble exist sound quality highly depends volume i feel sound difference speaker playing moreover volume envaya mini kef muo i also heard battery issue i recommend cool dual bluetooth speaker i really like speaker they used pair you option use stereo setup individually they bigger size compared speaker stronger sound you check photo i took water bottle idea size the battery lasting long enough enjoy wirelessly outdoors they nice rich sound they built mic used hand free calling they audio port hence use audio cable instead bluetooth connection they come usb charging cable audio cable

comment button also unitek offer incredible speaker reasonable price this bluetooth speaker awesome many way i loved much i got matching gold white one girlfriend she love look finding appearance rather classy clean the speaker look visually appealing i personally think one best looking bluetooth speaker i ever seen it clean metallic polish match perfectly color iphones i sure intention work i could get space grey color one match iphone ipad girlfriend get gold one match iphone the volume speaker quite solid volume control bit difficult control while i using volume control device rather easy boost volume lot minor control likely easier use device i personally bit bothered loud i end hearing turn sound power on bluetooth mode pairing etc even i music lower volume speaker end voicing rather loud volume to issue i trying play music lower volume night i wake anyone else likely voice turning device would wake the sound quality however mediocre the speaker seem able properly project full sound various song particular bass without proper projection detract song unfortunately i appreciate speaker include mic well top slot microsd insert music the battery life speaker average i calculated exact amount time active use i likely charge twice day which i personally find understandable given size i would ideally want speaker hold entire day charge what stopped giving device star however fact sound quality still bit lacking while i proclaim audiophile i still notice imbalance projection sound friend obsessed best sounding speaker get rather irked sound bit incomplete speaker additionally auxiliary port device would nice touch opinion i included two photo one show close compare size my hydroflask ounce see small speaker comparison despite size speaker substantial volume really project sound overall really solid bluetooth speaker likely one visually appealing one i seen used the volume great sound well rounded i would like it would also better auxiliary port bluetooth function still quite great i appreciate small size portable thing however would love even battery life longer i still like product enough also get one gold girlfriend us every day as side note need device blurt turned pairing may one shout word every time i turn pain i turning night note i received product discount free exchange honest unbiased review if clarification question concern regarding review please leave comment i happy get back thank taking time read review ok i admit first bluetooth speaker i ever tried i bluetooth receiver living room stereo system i get concept i always assumed little battery operated small speaker unit silly to significantly louder pair laptop speaker i assumed would get distorted tinny i happy report not case this thing actually pretty darned amazing i interested getting something kitchen since wife i like listen music cleaning phone tablet loud enough hear sound washing dish this thing delivers loud surprisingly clear audio the bass note actually caused kitchen table thump vibrate feel hand pick well it pair easily without passcode quickly switch phone connected time turning bluetooth one phone turning i test microsd card player function i like one i notice however button control actually difficult reach without picking they small underlip cylinder not biggest deal i happy controlling bluetooth rather use button local playback anyway the thing also surprisingly nice looking i notice mode seems attempt tuning fm radio station however i figure get anything static i seen similar bluetooth speaker offer aux input option us aux plug fm antenna i wondering us chip inside model think capable without aux input receive station no matter i expect functionality pros good sound quality it louder anything size business imo looks nice battery operated mean i take outside mount anywhere last thing i want kitchen another plugged appliance bluetooth wireless local playback using tf card slot cons at maximum volume sound start distort keep notch max it one speaker never get stereo effect monaural the button hard impossible press without picking see picture it apparently radio mode i figure tune get reception i given discount item product reviewer review unbiased honest possible in fact i going see i pick another one kid room loud amazing sound heavy this wireless speaker amazing it look great match several iphone release well material color scheme and physically heavy noticeably big speaker the main focus wireless speaker speaker minimalism using much room possibly speaker small area yet still barely enough room button hidden bottom way speaker the physical build manufacturing solid though micro usb cable port noticeably slanted small bit impede anything at bottom speaker main function button play pause answercall ignorecall hangup next volumeup previous volumedown mode lay hidden micro usb slot micro sd power switch on bottom several blue leds stay solid state the wireless speaker come manual though written well translated english literary completely confused fm function it state use micro usb cable plugged device usb port i eventually figure control easy require timing go i suggest plugging wireless speaker clearer signal fm mode change hold go auto search during switch usable channel clearest second time when come channel like press play pause button it pause second guessing retunes station clearer signal lock if repeat process switch channel reverse this well thought feature would annoying go every channel second time without display close limited time lock channel if fm mode hear static preformentioned method hit channel fairly quickly the sound quality amazing back bluetooth micro sd card it super clear loudest lot bass it feature board sound control mix bluetooth sound get really loud connecting bluetooth bit annoying though slow it good second timer intro turning power start bluetooth mode default power bluetooth mode pairing i love voice acting hear small bit accent i love several device i cannot compare sound clarity board voice acting telling whats going usually boring speaker super fuzzy grainy sound quality cannot hear saying there thing i could see could changed either update create updated version mainly would basically take button turn touch activated one would running bottom ring least likely pick device and auxiliary output input would much favored this would increase battery life small chunk phone wireless speaker i would also like see special adapter made device custom made plug micro usb port act like antenna fm mode wireless speaker the instruction could also include clearer instruction fm mode there lot space available back completely unused this wireless speaker i highly support suggest anyone looking wireless speaker it come

room filled sound the echo room made sound even better during test phone room next bathroom since yoyo also used phone call i tested feature worked expected pairing straightforward i turned speaker tapped yoyo phone couple second pairing done the yoyo could better button volume skipping track personal preference however intended use shower good current form im happy purchase son ecstatic new

walking etc now practical test the flashlight part work fine light power light saber grade still enough you see illuminating darkroom total darkness light source photo taken using asus zenfone laser smartphone distance table approx meter it quite wide flood type beam sure optic upgraded focused spot beam hey super duper flashlight work nice white color k color temperature cri feature lot much expensive flashlight missing i measured actual runtime ive measured battery capacity mah provide least hour continuous flashlight operation the power bank it delivers steady volt output current a after output voltage drop bit go v amp current this ok phone since usb voltage allows variation the battery capacity mah converted v output roughly mean mah output capacity translates charge average smartphone charge normal cell phone the speaker function it loud clear noticeable amount bass its sound quality par much expensive speaker ive compared bang olufsen beoplay a amount sound surely beyond compare quality difference much i mean compare two speaker one cost current price a cost asked currently most surprising part come connect speaker via aux connection instead bluetooth such connection allows use eq pump bass bit get much stronger oomph appears truly unbelievable friend see speaker playing mode starting search subwoofer sound powerful in fact jump turn loud music good amount drum bass i tried measure runtime speaker mode set full volume let music play i able withstand hour battery charge gone time so i estimate speaker give least hour loud clear music pc connection

pretty much expected small speaker begin pretty poor come clarity vocal classical music not huge deal primarily listen rock hip hop fact speaker sound overdriven time little annoying my best attempt correct sound involved software eq work rough pic eq attached the problem pretty predictable though high bit shrill low lacking detail heard song bass enough eq death mids fairly flat boring overall i would say speaker sound like average pair cheap computer speaker put pillow front cables included thin flimsy i doubt either hold long luckily us standard micro usb plug charging mm input want use bluetooth serious issue no hole rope carabiner being ruggedized outdoor speaker thread stand manufacturer seemed realize people might place put ground overlooked fairly standard feature most small outdoor speaker hole corner run rope similar could hook onto climbing pack belt anything else seems like oversight i went hardware store bought eyelet matching thread attach carabiner compensate i

received rattled terribly i thought i got bad pair ordered second set the second set slightly better first right control speaker set rattle sometimes excessively the speaker play adequately low volume turned even moderate level overcome normal background noise right speaker rattle least two two my recommendation purchase different speaker however positive aspect speaker attractive small sound quality bad right speaker rattle s usb speaker would certainly rate least based price update fix the source rattle three control button base speaker eliminate rattle place piece m magic tape button cut slightly larger width length button make sure enough tape keep button vibrating speaker housing the tape elastic permit button function done carefully detract speaker appearance the sound quite good even loud volume ordered two pair one box damaged total three corner broken cracked wasn difficult trace template cut hole the locking tab very fragile tighten losen turn cut thread plastic one tab broke speaker back i use remove speaker get apart i could use washer the plastic used cheap cheap not get aggressive took backing one small piece foam behind speaker try reduce echo noise i

speaker started when launched november picked favorable review new york times popular science usa today along fair share award design innovation i really tried give fair shake despite high expectation ultimately i found came far short sound quality five year launch i simply cannot recommend anyone it far long tooth competition fierce category ton amazing option the price often although cheaper third party seller depreciated way year old gadget even i hard pressed pull trigger jambox i guess i start i like speaker it smaller i expected i held big jambox honestly thought minute might mini so definitely portable as long sound compromised smaller size always welcome ala sound is compromised its construction apple esque it boast industrial weight molded rubber stainless steel mesh grill the design portion wikipedia page explains ad speak detail four side jambox wrapped single grill cut moving part the perforated metal sheath textured reduce vibration bear four distinct pattern visually reflect sound form geometric pattern brings artisan quality jamboxs pure box aesthetic while construction great quote speaks larger problem jambox aesthetic used mask truly disappointing sound quality exorbitant price but back good the bluetooth connection strong consistent the battery last advertised longer it charge via microusb need extra cable traveling bunch gadget and neutral point microphone speakerphone call i never use unfortunately jambox every portable bluetooth speaker day tick good box now bad judging audio quality subjective if spent time really listening high quality audio equipment difficult know missing ignorance bliss however i ignorant jambox sound bad the bass pathetically weak the mids high clear enough similarly pathetic inability really project smallest background noise at even moderate volume listening bass heavy track excruciating low sort fart distorted agony at high volume literally track clip distorts and worst part the highest volume even loud forget room filling highest volume level barely even cubicle filling its barely louder laptop speaker macbook pro i played track two side side maximum volume in fact laptop speaker arguably sound better jambox since least even bother attempt deep bass it large soundstage cool d effect sound speaker positioned directly front face the worst part horrendous sound quality jambox paying much these day buy absolutely bumping bluetooth speaker with jambox getting gorgeous looking utterly deficient functionally if considering buying jambox keep mind way hill the innovative design probably put shopping radar par course speakers lower price match list feature crush category really matterssound quality this product discontinued manufacturer basically rendering dead water you get firmware update product support way would newer speaker perhaps newer addition jambox lineup like big mini worth look instead i get impression bose soundlink mini currently occupies jamboxs old high class

return decided find exactly wrong thing so i diagnosed back battery i think polarity plug wrong plugged circuit board i sure the wire battery showed voltage i took plastic wrapper battery found pcb printed circuit board battery protector let battery voltage get certain voltage well either protect battery internals battery faulty battery voltage v btw i way past reassembly using if please dispose properly not bypass pcb charging battery directly voltage drop v directly terminal so i tested li ion battery dated june yr old i purchased rated mah manufacturer info it look cheap chinese generic branding no suprise tested high internal resistance capacitance test failed unable hold charge this either due improper pcb installation positive battery contact touching pcb protector output soldered wire preventing pcb job improper battery attachment main pcb general battery failure due defective component this probably probably due large number type failure noted amazon review do purchase

aug do not buy priced piece crap yesterday started screwing muting reason the mute light kept blinking tried different playback device thing samsung galaxy s edge older s bluetooth and aux granted i used lot past month i would expect durability bose product i never purchase bose crap today new jbl extreme arrives a guy i work one always blew away bose soundink i recently purchased set audio cable listen music car after month use audio jack became defective began lose connection after speaking manufacturer informed would pay s h fix rather paying shipping decided simply repurchase cable amazon see picture detail the manufacturer producing lower quality cable i bought audioengine direct i careful comparison cambridge audio minx air now cambridge list price i actually able get le audioengine really absurd given gulf class two the cambridge airplay bluetooth internet radio speaker whereas b bluetooth this bad news ios user since apple device support aptx decent bluetooth audio quality if use ios airplay far better option and frankly downgraded bluetooth day test i simply shocked people put pair device everytime seems crazy but people put lot trouble the audioengine way beautiful cambridge opinion but advantage stop there incredible gulf sound quality whereas cambridge sound broad open fill room b tinny restrictive the bass overemphasised really rough imprecise too much little quality the midrange metallic even extensive breaking by comparison cambridge feel like speaker much bigger size stereo imagining much better the cambridge feel like good approximation set bookshelf speaker the b sound marginally better built speaker ipad pro i really disappointed i love look i wanted love but good enough i see audioengine targeting computer geek rather traditional audiophile crowd the audioengine upgrade logicetch plastic computer speaker doubt but audiophile thing not even music lover thing and clear difference question bluetooth v airplay compression quality even comparing bluetooth v bluetooth wired v wired tell shape material speaker make difference oh one small defect common both cambridge b emit gentle hiss idle you hear putting ear close grille still it go show wireless speaker still way meeting audiophile standard i bought product month ago worked well start i notice water start build screen area i use speaker lightly time week sometimes week time it located shoulder height wetness got water splashing it never submerged left running water there water screen eventually stopped working completely except led background light after shaking clear full water it not fit it way too small if i attempt force stretch onto device definitely rip seam i surprised clearly nobody designed case cover angle ever tried actually put inside e gads the cube arrived today in addition two four side scratched unit power i tried several time avail i held power button instructed nothing happened i even attempted charge unit see would make work no luck either in addition cable provided fit android device including samsung htc in order get item connect pc apple computer i would need purchase additional cable see photo cable input device i received the device also absent operational button apparently use remote navigate device i recommend item i ton bluetooth speaker bose jawbone this little sucker right for price cannot beat quality sound update after owning day longer stay connected device sound crackly i tried charging way umpairing device nothing helped going order different one reordering one i going generous give two star since work music losing three i get correct product like many people it green square one flashing light pick talking via bluetooth i really disappointed wish i wasted money edit one star even charge whoever said bookshelf speaker moron me same believing at first box kind noticed expected then got worse the sound u marginally better year old jbl sat speaker and course i saying mobey spend cosmetically next led eye sore the bi amp bi wire function gimmick added value power whatsover they would probably look sound awesome living room would fit right but business relatively modern home today they powerful sound clear probably true speaker half price not worth price premium edited only straight end made metal plastic i learned i pulled car glovebox use one day the product description indicates right i

seemed little light weight i checked ohm run notch wire striper even cut thru insulation looks lot like wire label spool i guess i make trip home depot tomorrow get real deal would great price though and arrived super fast so least i wait week find ripoff i purchased two set single room left right matched pair the installation straight forward mostly poor instruction use term router mode inherent

promised fix follow provide instruction get fix when using multiple speaker also issue connection lost randomly using one speaker work fine in sum sound great work reliability issue lack compatibility itunes suggest look elsewhere i come background heavily involved music former night club operator owned large chain large capacity dance club major market often booked major recording artist early

the main draw speaker self powered feature need amplifier drive that usually space limitation need limitation due wanting port audio flat screen tv amp deliver supplemental sound better speaker typically contained flat screen having said i predecessor speaker av i reviewed several year ago noting lacked decent mid range sound making difficult use home theater speaker supplement flat screen tv sound typically dismal since flat screen rear firing speaker mounted back obviously clean line minimalist aesthetic appearance desired manufacturer front side screen so flat screen terrible trying

dialogue the av speaker av suffer short coming they bass heavy thumpy unnaturally boomy and bass delivery muddy reverb characteristic delivered echo chamber not crisp these speaker capable much better sound i found listening music desktop ipad air samsung s the critical key to getting decent sound out of these speakers is using a sound source with an equalizer so listening television output considering flat screen equalizer built output level i believe disappointed due way m audio set internal circuitry using poor crossover setting internal chip order make deliver bass heavy sound however ability manipulate sound source equalizer surprised good sound on pc ipad air i use itunes music playback course itunes equalizer built when i pull eq listen speaker sine wave curve flat db

curve resembles shallow v u see photo demonstrating itunes eq setting optimizing speaker av av begin deliver pretty darned good sound so tweeter bass driver capable pushing good air it bad m audio better setting deliver optimum sound flat signal source now first glance might ask sine wave curve db setting low high i see boosted range claimed culprit speaker poor sound although seems counter intuitive reason eq setting relative setting within sound band spectrum curve set flat db gain retard speaker internally set deliver much one area little relative one another and thus push volume flat speaker source level want listen sound good manufacturer internal setting after set optimum sine wave curve eq able generate really nice sound volume level especially push would considered loud without eq speaker way boomy muddy volume but eq really drive hard quality sound size so without mumbo jumbo know speaker really good linked sound source equalized forget using sound straight line

give stars would unfair might consider star review subsequently really disappointed speaker never tried equalize sound setting source device and i think wonderful amazon review pretty quickly zero reason purchase avoid purchase thing smart analyze review whenever i read review very first thing i go star review see product weakness might i get enthused star review then i balanced idea product i go back positive review i generally read many star review strength clearly defined star major flaw clearly apparent star but i also consider balance percentage if star review massively outweigh star e versus negative i consider lemon inherent product unquestionably deserve consideration especially manufacturer seller willing make right purchase so i give star review review stand enough allow others zero make speaker much satisfactory purchase if star range unlikely many consumer would read review discover might enjoy purchase easy sensible solution overcome speaker poor internal crossover design by way know mean simplest term speaker built circuitry determines part inbound signal sent woofer low drive part inbound signal sent tweeter high that called crossover point with today technology host

product i hoping issue will update rating depending outcome zip broke first day poor quality i cannot use i considering buying monitor k ips version year finally took plunge the backlight bleed review scared i replacing ancient p tn panel i figured i might le bothered stuff others boy i wrong i replacement coming i update review come better worse so first get backlight bleed need accept buying on mine corner severely affected one corner something i would ok although people probably it seems like something happens monitor period mine bad bottom right visible corner when screen black corner affected extremely brighter take away whatever movie video game whatever i added picture one sent show backlight bleed the big problem i though something i read review the color especially white worse ancient tn panel whites white even extensive color balance setting change osd setting icc profile factory reset work i tried another image even improvement via osd setting see old monitor right much better color for monitor worth car outdone almost decade old tn panel beyond unacceptable even considering backlight bleed if i paid half price say buck i would still return it baffling could charge much something low quality consistency my old p tn monitor g hl look astoundingly better every way pixel count viewing angle i could buy price crossing finger replacement solves reduces issue edit the replacement monitor similar backlight bleed issue bad ignore one also bright spot defect bottom left quadrant screen i able get color decent one default setting came seemed poor horrible color banding almost sepia tone reason it even close edit ended going hz monitor refresh rate increase better k resolution case when acer accepts ship amount faulty screen dead pixel light bleed mean one thing we acer cannot throw screen trash loose lot money instead said oh let sell faulty stuff people get get angry get return refurbish sell totally damaged loss loose screen money garbage light bleed bottom right corner look reddish upper left corner black light overall look right side see reddish black look upper corner well care plastic neat look expensive care screen garbage screen suffers light bleed strong question absolutely going get light bleed around corner matter wish strong well mine look reddish back light even sunlight visible disastrous though brought gta gaming im gonna use smoke cigarette year gonna give somebody bring something better good screen brand release one cant return due shipping cost oversees this ips uhd monitor come g sync as pay quite price premium better expect top line quality unfortunately acer xb hk fall far short product deserves priced highly my first purchase monitor two dead pixel many many i going call sub dead pixel in picture attached review i held camera le inch away screen displaying solid black image you clearly see red dead pixel middle image however pixel see black i call sub dead their color able seen getting close screen closer safe comfortable viewing something notice still clear lack quality entire screen apparent i seen review complain backlight bleed i test the viewing angle alone large monitor cause color distortion fact technology problem different backlight bleed i seen one review complained glitching flickering this something i encountered monitor using displayport cable different monitor x ips i issue never seen flickering two three year i used however monitor average one occurrence every two hour le one second flicker glitch either entire screen quickly go black come back vertical strip varying length screen quickly flicker corrupted red green mix fix quickly i say average certainly predictable certainly occur given enough time the flickering i deal something happens time the sub dead pixel i much problem since apparent greater six eight inch away monitor monitor large must distance anyway order see screen however dead pixel delivery simply acceptable k monitor i returning replacement if replacement also fails quality standard i likely find non g sync ips uhd monitor another company higher quality i pretty excited finally getting use backyard family movie night huge disappointment the sound weak way beef the first time tried use i assumed poor sound quality ultra thin piece speaker wire included so i bought nice heavy gauge wire wait try beefy wire made difference whatsoever i even imagine possible watt pair speaker they certainly feel sturdy big heavy but really way overbuilt minimal sound produce we tried everything make sure bad connection handling i discovered not watt even close they mere thirty watt that made lot sense much consistent weak sound we imagined watching family movie backyard would lot fun everyone we figured plenty sound u looking forward movie even kid would rather play friend but way could hear anything kid absolutely quiet micro manage family fun night neither fun relaxing disappointing part feel like watt description surely must typo everything else speaker price size weight even review expect speaker lot power measly watt watt nothing get excited hard understand rave review unless lot people aware watt sound like nobody strain hear movie after eliminated sound felt competing earspace ac kid playing conversation among adult it disappointing especially i use speaker caliber going take space i find home whatever case i m keeping pyle pair wall

work i originally purchased i two i put next get sense divergent reading would it good one read read see photo i wrote support clearly least one defective no reply i suggest skipping looking eve room product instead i bought hoping would play nice homekit device various manufacturer the general premise behind apple homekit device certified play nice homekit device thus locking one vendor this case iss in order trigger automated event case i wanted turn another homekit plug another manufacturer temperature exceeded range example turn fan temperature exceeds f you use default apple home app accomplish the thing actually work apple home app motion sensor detects movement trigger something else you cannot trigger event temperature humidity light sensor apple home app i sure limitation apple homekit app device manufacturer the work around the way use sensor use ihome app several string attached you create kind login ihome mean need give personal information email first name last name even after sign account only use sensor temperature humidity light sensor ihome device meaning locked vendor totally defeat purpose this product absolutely terrible i work technical field installing custom audio video system year experience computer building repairing etc lack knowledge issue i using lg smartthings hub alexa voice control philips hue lighting honeywell lyric thermostat miscellaneous thing the first time i got smart outlet took literally hour get work i emailed tech support department explaining attempt get working using nexus lenovo tablet suggestion i got i needed use ios android device i pretty sure nexus phone google phone company owns android android device the boot screen lenovo android tablet also indicates us android operated system much help i finally get working resetting device two dozen time entering activation code many time worked yesterday i changed wifi device every smart home device app i easily synced back new wifi ihome app could locate device half dozen reset result anything new i finally unplugged device left day i work returned evening plugged back after resetting time finally appeared app i thought would okay entering code nuisance scanning wifi entering password scanning would pair wifi you see photo outlet solid green light supposed indicate connected wifi app the next photo show error android perhaps start turning thing mean neighbor controlling wifi personally i think ihome saved money wasted including useless remote control product put money engineering device worked reliably i would give zero star i could i really disappointed it almost week able get work android getting unhelpful form email advanced support i actually speak i giving i successfully tested used dozen brand kind sensor this least helpful support i what happened i followed instruction get point app trying connect teach sensor wifi password go back forth direct wifi ab wifi provides error sometimes tell reset i half dozen time sometimes give different error promoting retry i then i called customer service the nice ignorant rep wanted charge hour i tried i asked familiar product realized charge powered actually repeated apparently trying get phone when i pressed better support idea took contact info promised email response within hour several day later i got form email telling bunch basic troubleshooting ios i told previous rep i used android i also told person issue none addressed form email response i got and still way speak anyone last three initial support team there many good product continue waste time i highly recommend canary basically good customer service better app opinion i recommend anyone lot debate everyone taste different usage different well my perspective good pa background speaker casual listening chore infact sweet sounding meaning kill ear brightness detail certain speaker maybe fault horrible recording better system reveal get much listener fatigue high tweeter cut around k definitely house sound but critically listening sound rather monotone transparency sound muffled rather veiled they take lot power abuse though need sit head i a vice like ribbon electrostatics speaker pleasant casual background listening modern receiver tend clip sound better vinatge ch receiver decent amp like adcom etc i mainly got friend kept buying lifestyle bose system depite advise absurdly overpriced bose mostly mmmarketing they believe then heard side side even cheapest speaker i castle monitor audio kef etc believe muffled sounded comparison shock face told story these overpriced like lifestyle system term material cost build also some people bash paper driver paper actually sound among mist natural metal cone kevlar properly engineered used audio note scan speak etc for are critical use they maunely serve tv stand probably used garage however music taste subjective sound good stick some audiophile speaker also sound horrible annoying vid listener fatigue not really control pro why inch woofer spec control pro another version control exists sold a inch driver pointed others control pro box control pro spec box sound mediocre best why would another control pro sold much higher price at least uk site show inch woofer belonging jbl model control pro update based info comment i revising review it apparently meet definition measurement speaker world given mounting flange included overall dimension sizing driver seems manufacturer could add bit frame call inch woofer kind like getting inch pizza topping inner inch haha i stand mediocre sound though i purchased two speaker october one started breaking buzzing around middle december when i removed speaker replace i discovered material join speaker cone basket separated speaker basket around half circumference speaker this happen speaker rated watt max i running alpine watt per channel amp i got month half use speaker died luckily amazon refunded money without question for charging basically usb hub your device much docked situated upon use basic usb cord connect speaker you take cord holder order connect device the device play audio usb use aux bluetooth play audio the bluetooth connected fine worked phone control also the box i got little rough this device new i get next day so disappointing this worth just get usb charging hub bluetooth speaker it cheaper organized i bought year ago within year connection charge popped see photo very displeased quality product do buy purchased protect b o a blue color permanently permeated grey soft material metallic part speaker leaving blue blotch cannot removed even nasty harsh cleaner bummed actually damaged speaker'"
